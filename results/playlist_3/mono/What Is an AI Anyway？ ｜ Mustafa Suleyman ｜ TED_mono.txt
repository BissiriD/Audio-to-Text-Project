thei want to tell you what i see comingi've been lucky enough to be working on ai for almost fifteen years nowback when i started to describe it as fringe would be an understatement researchers would say no no we were only working on machine learning because working on ai was seen as way too out there in two thousand and ten just the very mention of the phrase a i artificial general intelligence would get you some seriesthe strange looks and even a cold shoulder you're actually building ai people would say isn't that something out of science fictionpeople thought it was fifty years away or one hundred years away if it was even possible at all talk of ai was i guess kind of embarrassing people generally thought we were weird and i guess in some ways we kind of wereit wasn't long though before i started beating humans at a whole range of tasks that people previously thought were way out of reachunderstanding images translating languages transcribing speech playing go and chess and even diagnosing diseasespeople started waking up to the fact that ai was going to have an enormous impact and they were rightly asking technologists like me some pretty tough questions is it true that ai is going to solve the climate crisis will it make personalized education available to everyone does it mean we'll all get universal basic income and we won't have to workanymoreshould i be afraid what does it mean for weapons in war and of course will china when are we in a raceare we headed for a mass misinformation apocalypse all good questionsbut it was actually a simpler and much more kind of fundamental question that left me puzzledone that actually gets to the very heart of my work every dayone morning over breakfast my six year old nephew caspian was playing with pi the ai created at my last company inflection with a mouthful of scrambled eggs he looked at me plane in the face and said but mustapha war is an ai anywayhe's such a sincere and curious and optimistic little guy he'd been talking to by about how cool it would be if one day in the future he could visit dinosaurs at the zoo and how he could make infinite amounts of chocolate at home and why pi couldn't yet play i spywell i said it's a clever piece of software that's read most of the text on the open internet and it can talk to you about anything you wantright so like a person theni was stumpedgenuinely left scratching my headall my boring stock answers came rushing through my mind nova ai is just another general purpose technology like printing or steam it'll be a tool that will augment us and make us smarter and more productive and when it gets better over time it'll be like an all knowing oracle that will help us solve grand scienceepic challenges all of these responses started to feel i guess little bit defensiveand actually better suited to a policy seminar them breakfast with a no nonsense six year old why am i hesitating i thought to myselflet's be honest my nephew was asking me a simple question that those of us in a i just don't confront often enoughwhat is it that we are actually creating what does it mean to make something totally new fundamentally different to any invention that we have known beforeit is clear that we are an inflection point in the history of humanityon our current trajectory we're headed towards the emergence of something that we are all struggling to describeand yet we cannot control what we don't understandand so the metaphors the mental models the names these all matter if we're to get the most out of ai whilst limiting its potential downsidesas someone who embraces the possibilities of this technology but who's also always cared deeply about it's ethics we should i think be able to easily describe what it is we're building and that includes the six year olds so it's in that spirit that i offer up today the following metaphor for helping us to try to grapple withwhat this moment really is i think ai should best be understood as something like a new digital species now don't take this too literally but i predict that we'll come to see them as digital companions new partners in the journeys of all our liveswhether you think we are on a ten twenty or thirty year path here this is in my view the most accurate and most fundamentally honest way of describing what's actually coming and above all it enables everybody to prepare for and shape what comes nextnow i totally get this is a strong claim and i'm going to explain to everyone as best i can why i'm making it but first let me just try to set the context from the very first microscopic organisms life on earth stretches back billions of years over that time life evolved and diversified thanfew million years ago something began to shiftafter countless cycles of growth and adaptation one of life's branches began using tools and that branch grew into us we went on to produce a mesmerizing variety of tools at first slowly and then with astonishing speed we went from stone axesand fireto language writing and eventually industrial technologies one invention unleashed a thousand more and in time we became homo technologic us around eighty years ago another new branch of technology began with the invention of computers we quickly jumpedfrom the first mainframes and transistors to today's smartphones and virtual reality headsets information knowledge communication computation in this revolution creation has exploded like never beforeand now a new wave is upon usartificial intelligence these waves of history are clearly speeding up as each one is amplified and accelerated by the last and if you look back it's clear that we are in the fastest and most consequential wave everthe journeys of humanity and technology are now deeply intertwined in just eighteen months over a billion people have used large language models we've witnessed one landmark event after another just a few years ago people said the ai would never be creativeand yet ai now feels like an endless river of creativity making poetry and images and music and video that stretch the imagination people said it would never be empathetic and yet today millions of people enjoy meaningful conversations with a eyes talking about their hopes and dreams and helpring them work through difficult emotional challenges ai can now drive cars manage energy grids and even invent new molecules just a few years ago each of these was impossibleand all of this is turbocharged by spiralling exponential of data and computation last year inflection two point five now last modelused five billion times more computation than the deep mind ai that beat the old school atari games just over ten years ago that's nine orders of magnitude more computation ten x per year every year for almost a decade over the same time the size ofthese models has grown from first tens of millions of parameters to then billions of parameters and very soon tens of trillions of parameters if someone did nothing but read twenty four hours a day for their entire life that consume eight billion words and of course that's a lot of words but today the mostadvanced day eyes consume more than eight trillion words in a single month of training and all of this is set to continue the long arc of technological history is now in an extraordinary new phase so what does this mean in practice we're just as the internetgave us the browser and the smartphone gave us apps the cloud based supercomputer is ushering in a new era of ubiquitous a eyes everything will soon be represented by a conversational interface or to put it another way a personal aiand these eyes will be infinitely knowledgeable and soon there'll be factually accurate and reliable they'll have near perfect i qthey'll also have exceptional eec eu there'll be kind supportive empatheticthese elements on their own would be transformational just imagine if everybody had a personalized tutor in their pocket and access to low cost medical advice a lawyer and a doctor a business strategist and coach all in your pocket twenty four hours a day but things really start to change when they develop what i calldo the actions question this is their ability to actually get stuff done in the digital and physical world and before long it won't just be people that have eyes strange as it may sound every organization from small business to nonprofit to national government each will have their ownevery town building an object will be represented by a unique interactive persona and these won't just be mechanistic assistance there'll be companions confidence colleagues friends and partners as varied and unique as we all areat this point as will convincingly imitate humans at most tasksand will fill this at the most intimate of scales and ai organizing a community get together for an elderly neighbor a sympathetic expert helping you make sense of a difficult diagnosis but will also feel it at the largest scales accelerating scientific discovery autonomous cars on the roads drones in the skiescause they'll both order the takeout and run the power station they'll interact with us and of course with each other they'll speak every language taken every pattern of sensor data sights sounds streams and streams of information far surpassing what any one of us could conceivezoom in one thousand lifetime so what is this what are these eyesif we are to prioritize safety above all else to ensure that this new wave always serves and amplifies humanity then we need to find the right metaphors for what this might becomefor years we in the ai community and i specifically have had a tendency to refer to this as just toolsbut that doesn't really capture what's actually happening hereai is a clearly more dynamic more ambiguous more integrated and more emergent than mere tools which are entirely subject to human control so to contain this wave to put human agency at it's center and to mitigate the inevitable unintended consequences that are likely to ariseguys we should start to think about them as we might a new kind of digital species now it's just an analogy it's not a literal description and it's not perfect we first start they clearly aren't biological in any traditional sense but just pause for a moment and really think about what they already dothey communicate in our languages they see what we see they consume unimaginably large amounts of informationthey have memorythey have personalitythey have creativitythey can even reason to some extent and formulate rudimentary plansthey can act autonomously if we allow themand they do all this at levels of sophistication that is far beyond anything that we've ever known from a mere tooland so saying ai is mainly about the math or the code is like saying we humans are mainly about carbon and waterit's true but it completely misses the pointand yes i get it this is a super arresting thought but i honestly think this frame helps sharpen our focus on the critical issueswhat are the riskswhat are the boundaries that we need to imposewhat kind of ai do we want to build or allow to be builtthis is a story that is still unfolding nothing should be accepted as a given we almost choose what we create what ai we bring into the worldor notthese are the questions for all of us here today and all of us alive at this momentfor me the benefits of this technology are stunningly obvious and they inspire my life's work every single daybut quite frankly they'll speak for themselvesover the years i've never shied away from highlighting risks and talking about downsidesthinking in this way helps us focus on the huge challenges that lie ahead for all of usbut let's be clear there is no path to progress where we leave technology behind the price for all of civilization is immense we need solutions in healthcare and education to our climate crisis and if ai delivers just a fraction of its potential the next decade isgoing to be the most productive in human historyhere's another way to think about it in the past unlocking economic growth often came with huge downsides the economy expanded as people discovered new continents and opened up new frontiersbut they colonized populations at the same timewe built factories but they were grim and dangerous places to work we struck oil but we polluted the planet now because we are still designing and building ai we have the potential and opportunity to do it better radically better and today we're not discovering andnew continent and plundering its resources were building one from scratch sometimes people say that data or chips of the twenty first century's new oilbut that's totally the wrong imageai is to the mind what nuclear fusion is to energylimitless abundant world changingan ai really is different now means we have to think about it creatively and honestly we have to push our analogies that are metaphors to the very limits to be able to grapple with what's coming because this is not just another inventionai is itself an infinite inventor and yes this is exciting and promising and concerning and intriguing all at onceto be quite honest it's pretty surreal but step back see it on the long view of glacier time and these really are the very most appropriate metaphors that we have today since the beginning of life on earthwe've been evolving changing and then creating everything around us in our human world todayan ai isn't something outside of this story in fact it's the very opposite it's the whole of everything that we have created distilled down into something that we can all interact with and benefit fromit's a reflection of humanity across time and in this sense it isn't a new species at all this is where the metaphors end here's what i'll tell caspian next time he asksai isn't separate ai isn't even in some senses newai is us it's all of us and this is perhaps the most promising and vital thing of all that even a six year old can get a sense foras we build out ai we can and must reflect all that is good all that we love all that is special about humanity or empathy or kindness our curiosity and our creativitythis i would argue is the greatest challenge of the twenty first century but also the most wonderful inspiring and hopeful opportunity for all of us thank youthat kind of stuff as it's an amazing vision and a super powerful metaphor you're in an amazing position right now i'm in you you are connected at the hip to the amazing work happening at open ai you're going to have resources made available there are reports ofthis giant new data centers one hundred billion dollars invested and so forthand a new species can emerge from it i mean you you've done in your book you did as well as painting an incredible optimistic vision you work super eloquent on the dangers of ai and i'm just curious where from the view that you have now what is it that most keeps you up at night i think the great riskis that we get stuck in what i call the pessimism aversion trap we have to have the courage to confront the potential of dark scenarios in order to get the most out of all the benefits that we see so the good news is that if you look at the last two or three years there have been very very few downsides right it's very hard to say explicitlythe what harm an llm has caused but that doesn't mean that that's what the trajectory is going to be over the next ten years so i think if you pay attention to a few specific capabilities take for example autonomy autonomy is very obviously a threshold over which we increase risk in our society and it's something that we should step towards very very closethe the other would be something like recursive self improvement if you allow the model to independently self improve update it's own code explore an environment without oversight and without a human into in control to change how it operates that would obviously be more dangerous but i i think there were still some way away from thatit's still a good five to ten years before we have to really confront that but it's time to start talking about it now a digital species unlike any biological species can replicate not in nine months but in nine nanoseconds and produce an indefinite number of copies of itself all of which have more power than we have and in many ways i meanthe possibility for unintended consequences seems pretty immense and isn't it true that if a problem happens it could happen in an hour know that that is really not true i think there's no evidence to suggest that and i think that that's often referred to as the intelligence explosion and i think it is a theoretical highhypothetical maybe that we're all kind of curious to explore but there is no evidence that we're anywhere near anything like that and i think it's very important that we choose our words super carefully because you're right that's one of the weaknesses of the species framing right we will design the capability for self replication into it if people choose to dothat and i would actually argue that we should not that would be one of the dangerous capabilities that we should step back from right so there's there's no chance that this will emerge accidentally i really think that's a very low probability it will it will happen if engineers deliberately designed those capabilities in and if they don't take enough efforts to deliberately design them outand so this is the point of being explicit and transparent about trying to introduce safety by design very early onso thank you i mean your vision of humanity injecting into this new thing the best parts of ourselves avoiding all those weird biological freaky horrible tendencies that we can have in certain circumstance i mean that is a very inspiring vision and thank you so much for coming here and sharing it thank you had to think that a loti
