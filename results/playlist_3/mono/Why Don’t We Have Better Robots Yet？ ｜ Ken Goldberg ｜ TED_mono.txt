i have a feeling most people in this room would like to have a robot at home be nice to be able to do the chores and take care of things where are these robots what's taking so long i mean we have our try quarters and we hahave satellites we have laser beams but where are the robotsi mean okay wait we do have some robots in our home but not really doing anything that exciting okaynow i've been doing research at u c berkeley for thirty years with my students on robots and in the next ten minutes i'm going to try to explain the gap between fiction and reality now we've seen images like this rate these are real robots they're pretty amazing but those of us who work in thefield well the reality is more like thisthat's ninety nine out of one hundred times that's what happens and in the field there's something that explains this that we call more of x paradox and that is what's easy for robots like being able to pickup a large object large heavy object is hard for humans but whywhat's easy for humans like being able to pick up some blocks and stack them well it turns out that is very hard for robotsand this is a persistent problem so the ability to grasp arbitrary objects is a grand challenge for my field now by the way i was a very klutzy kid i was i would drop things anytime someone would throw me a ball i would drop it i was the last kid to get picked on a basketball teamim i'm still pretty klutzy actually but i have spent my entire career studying how to make robots less clumsynow let's start with the hardware so the hands now these are this is a robot hand a particular type of hand it's a lot like our hand and it has a lot of motors a lot of tendons and cables as you can see so it's unfortunately not very reliable it's also very heavy and very expensive so i'm in favor ofvery simple hands like this so this has just two fingers it's known as a parallel jaw gripper so it's very simple it's lightweight and reliable and it's very inexpensive and if you're doubting that simple hands can be effective look at this video where you can seethat two very simple grippers these are being operated by the by the way by humans who are controlling the grippers like a puppet but very simple grippers are capable of doing very complex things no actually it industry there's even a simpler robotic gripper and that's the suction cup and that only makes a single point of contact so again simplicity is very highhopefully in our field now let's talk about the software this is where it gets really really difficult because of a fundamental issue which is uncertainty there's uncertainty in the control there is uncertainty in the perception and there's uncertainty in the physics now what do i mean by the control wellif you look at a robot's gripper trying to do something it's there's a lot of uncertainty in the cables and the mechanisms that cause very small errors and these can accumulate and make it very difficult to manipulate thingsnow in terms of the sensors yes robots have very high resolution cameras just like we do and that allows them to take images of scenes in traffic or in a retirement center or in a warehouse or in an operating room but these don't give you the three dimensional structure of what's going on so reasononly there was a new development called lidar and this is a new class of cameras that use light beams to build up of three dimensional model of the environmentand these are fairly effective they really were a breakthrough in our field but they're not perfect so if the objects have anything that's shiny or transparent well then the light acts in unpredictable ways and ends up with noise and holes in the images so these aren't really the silver bullet and there's one other form of censor out there nownow called a tactile sensor and these are very interesting they use cameras to actually image the surfaces as a robot will make contact but these are still in their infancynow the last issue is the physics and let me illustrate for you by showing you we take a bottle on a table and we just push it and the robots pushing in exactly the same way each time but you can see that the bottle ends up in a very different place each time and why is that well it's because it depends on thein microscopic surface topography underneath the bottle as it slid for example if you put a grain of sand under there it would react very differently than if there weren't a grain of sand and we can't see if there's a grain of sand because it's under the bottle it turns out that we can predict the motion of an asteroid a mimillion miles away far better than we can predict the motion of an object as it's being grasped by a robotnow let me give you an example put yourself here into the position of being a robot trying to clear the table and your sensors are noisy and imprecise your actuators your cables and motors or are uncertain so you can't fully control your own gripper and there is uncertainty in the physics so you really don't know what'shappen so it's not surprising that robots are still very clumsynow there's one spot for robots and that has to do with ecommerce and this has been growing it's a huge trend and during the pandemic it really jumped up i think most of us can relate to that and we started ordering things like never before and this trend is continuing and the challenge is to meet the demandwe have to be able to get all these packages delivered in a timely manner and the challenges that every package is different every order is different so you might order some some nail polish and an electric screwdriver and those two objects are going to be somewhere inside one ofthese giant warehouses and what needs to be done if someone has to go in find the nailpolish and then go and find the screwdriver bring them together put them into a box and deliver them to you so this is extremely difficult it requires grasping so today this is almost entirely done with humans the humans don't like doing this work there's a huge amount of turnoverso it's a challenge and people have tried to put robots into warehouses to do this workias it turned out all that well but my students and i about five years ago we came up with a method using advances in ai deep learning to have a robot essentially train itself to be able to grasp objects and the idea was that the rowi will do this and simulation it was almost as if the robot was dreaming about how to grasp things and learning how to grasp them reliably and here's the result this is a system called dex net that is able to reliably pickup objects that we put into these bins in front of the robot these are objects it's never been trained on and it's able to pick these upnext up and reliably clear these bins over and over again so we were very excited about this result and the students and i went out to form a company and we now have a company called ambi robotics and what we do is make machines that use the algorithms the software we developed at berkeley to hppickup packages and this is for e-commerce the packages arrive in large bins all different shapes and sizes and they have to be picked up scanned and then put into smaller bins depending on their zip code we now have eighty of these machines operating across the united states sorting over a million packages a weeknow that's that's some progress but it's not exactly the home robot that we're all been waiting for so i want to give you a little bit of an idea of some of the new research that we're doing to try to be able to have robots more capable in homes and one particular challenge is being able to manipulate deformable objectslike strings in one dimension two dimensional sheets and three dimensions like like like fruits and vegetables so we've been working on a project to to untangle knots and what we do is we take a cable we put that in front of the robot it has to use a camera to look down analyze the cable figure out where to graspbut and how to pull it apart to be able to untangle it and this is a very hard problem because the cable is much longer than the reach of the robot so it has to go through and manipulate manage the slack as it's working and i would say this is doing pretty well it's gotten up to about eighty percent success when we give it a tangled cable at being able to untangle itthe other one is something i think we also are waiting for robot to fold the laundry now roboticists have actually been looking at this for a long time and there was some research that was done on this but the problem is that it's very very slow so this is about three to sixfolds per hour okay so we decided to free to revisit this problem and try to have a robot work very fast so what are the things we did was try to think about a two armed robot that could fling the fabric the way we do when we're folding and then we also used friction in this case to drag the fabric to opt to smooth out some wrinkleswarrant a trip which is known as the two second fold you might have heard of this it's amazing because the robot is doing exactly the same thing and then it's a little bit longer but that's real time it's not sped up so we're making some progress thereand the last example is baggage so you all counter this all the time you go to a corner store and you have to put something in a bag now it's easy again for humans but it's actually very very tricky for robots because for humans you know how to take the bag and how to manipulate it but robots the bag can arrive in many different configurations it's very hard to tell what's gogoing on and for the robot to figure out how to open up that bag so what we did was we had the robot train itself by we painted one of these bags with fluorescent paint and we had fluorescent lights that would turn on and off and the robot would essentially teach itself how to manipulate these bags so we've got it now up to thepoint where we are able to solve this problem about half the time so it works but i'd say it's still we're still not we're still not quite there yet so i want to come back to more of x paradox what's easy for robots is hard for humans and what's easy for us is still hard for robots we have in creditfull capabilities we're very good at manipulationbut robots still are not there i want to say i understand it's been sixty years and we're still waiting for the robots that the jetsons had why is this difficult we need robots because we want them to be able to do tasks that we cancan't do or we don't really want to do but i want you to keep in mind that these robots they're coming just be patient because we want the robots but robots also need us to do the many things that robots still can't dovacantthree
