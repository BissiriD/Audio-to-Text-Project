thelet me begin by saying that what you are looking gets is not real these are artificial corals created by a generative algorithm trained with more than one hundred million cuddle imagesacross the globe seawater is becoming less habitable use of the climate change and the coral reefs are dying rapidlyone day we might be on the left with the simulations of corals in a virtual world with this project coral dreams our aim is touse aiand try to create actual realities while preserving disappearing naturei'm going meet the artists and directors my team and i have been using generative ai as a collaborator for seven years although it feels like seventy we train machine learning algorithms by harnessing large focused and publicly available datasets and visualizing what i call humanitiescollective memories such as nature urban and culturesince pandemic my focus has been to compile the largest datasets and artificially preserve naturei am optimistic about generative ai because of this potential for enhancing our memories we as artists can utilize this potential not only to represent nature but also to remember how it feels to be immersed in it in a digital ageguarantee ai creates possibilities to train algorithms with any image sound text and even sent data for example is floral dreams and algorithm trained with more than seventy five million floral images of sixteen thousand speciesby using more than half million sans molecules we were able to create the scent of his dreamsnow let's please imagine a living archive that we can walk into a universe that is constantly reimagining the contract this forms patterns colors and scentsour life is becoming increasingly route of the digital world and the boundaries between physical and virtual technology and nature are blurringderivative ai helps us to create new realities and also project onto reality through possible to space can we go to dead space can be filled with our feelings our senseslarge language models is just the beginning of a long journey of innovations will bring more possibilities soon i believe we will be exploring hyper models text the image to sound to sense to lifeand a beak challenge using generative ai in art is have to provide models with original datafor this project glitter dreams we decided not to use existing models instead we decided to collect our own image sound sand and climate databy traveling to our first destination islands' we were able to capture the beginning of our own narratives of glaciersi also believe that a ice capacity can be mapped onto the complex history of human wisdom and consciousness in nature could we use ai to preserve and learn about initial knowledge in naturethis was one of the first question in my mind when i met with the wonderful leaders of one of a tribe in brazil accra amazonia in rainforestmy mentors on heroes chief niche ivanka and his creative force pattani who oversee their cultural preservation and ecological sanctuary i became deeply inspired by their ways of learning and remembering already existing knowledge in naturetogether we started to new project respectful co-creation and open source ai rainforest modelwith this model generative ai can even reconstruct extinct flora and fauna based on the tribe's deep and collective knowledge this project will help us hopefully to bring ancient wisdom to our society respectfullymy hope is that one day i becomes a mirror that can reflect collected memories of all humanity and i do believe that we can use it to bring people of any agent culture inspiration joy and hope thoughthank youthree
