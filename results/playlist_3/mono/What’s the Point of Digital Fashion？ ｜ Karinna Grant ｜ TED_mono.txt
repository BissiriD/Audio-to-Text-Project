theby twenty thirty three you just might have a smaller wardrobe then you have not not just because you've already checked which items spark joy but because you probably want one as much physical clothing i'm not just saying this because typically we own more than we need and we actually only wear twentyeighty percent of our wardrobe but because dematerialization will have taken over fashion think about the books that you own the music that we listen to they are now in the cloud and many of our favorite stores are online and this is happening to wear clothes to digital versions of physicsapple products and digital only products are making their way into our lives through gaming social media and shopping this is an alexander mcqueen digital t that you can download to an avatar earth's were inside a gamedigital fashion is made of pixels rather than threads and it's still a relatively new sector of the virtual goods industry but in the last five years it's kind of exploded and we've seen zeit geist moments from digital first brands like the fabricant tribute brand and or robo rossan artifact who got the world talking about vegetables physical and digital versions that you buy together and luxury brands are also in this space like wheaton but then thiago and gucci and they're doing something surprising at surprising price points so they are bringing teatogether the worlds of gaming and luxury some of these items are less than twenty dollars and this gucci roadblocks handbag actually resold for four thousand dollars which is more than the physical one retails for just an hour after it went for sale or roadblocks this is interestthe thing because quite often our first luxury purchase is sunglasses or a lipstick in the in the near future and especially for the next generation that's not going to be the case it will be a virtual item that you can wear just like that handbag inside a game and if your pockets are deep enoughyou can also pay luxury prices a crypto bronx and tiffany last year did a collaboration where they made digital pendants two hundred and fifty personalized ones which were the princely sum of fifty thousand dollarsi am a fashion academic and innovator and i've spent a lot of years researching how and when people adopt new trends whether their dad sneakers or snapchat filters and it's kind of ironic because i fell in love with digital fashion because i like vintage fashion and the thought of being able to wear key pieces fromfashion history is something that keeps me awake who eats at night this jacket by mugler has been painstakingly digitized by superficial studio was super exciting is that we're at the very beginning of this revolution within fashion and when it goes mainstream probably within the next five yearsit's really going to change not only what we wear but also how we produce and consume goods hopefully for the betterjust because something isn't physico doesn't mean it's not real and just because something is dematerialized doesn't mean it gives you a warm funny feeling in your stomach when you buy it or owner or wear it especially when it looks like this so for digital fashion there's something really for everybodyfrom sportswear to couture so the kind of stereo ethereal and when i see pieces like these that are so cool that i want to own them physically i get frustrated because there isn't a word to describe that so i've started calling it matter desireand i'm still working on an emoji for it which i think is very importantdigital fashion is characterized by infinite creativity when you design and the physical dimension you unfortunately have constraints like gravity how a fabric drapes perhaps the cost of raw materials but when you design virtually you have limitless possibilities of see for example will addresscould look like how it could perform or function this is a piece by institute of digital fashion which is part jewelry part clothing and in the near future we have completely new categories of materials and products and magazines are also using this as well they're adopting digital fashionand to make the pages and the fashion become more immersive but so what that's what my mum often asks me what's the point of digital fashion well you have two choices you can either wear it on your real self your physical self or you can wear it on your digital self and gamers have already beendoing this for over twenty five years they already understand the value of virtual goods they've been earning modifying and putting skins and cosmetics on their characters to wear inside gamesdigital dressing is a thing this is me during the pandemic when i couldn't get to any stores but i could get a dopamine hit and of course share it on social mediayou you guys can try this yourself if you go to a platforms like the dematerialized or address x and a relatively new companies zero ten also does this so digital dressing is when an extra layer like an augmented reality is added onto a photo or a video and this is sosomething which i call soft wearables so effectively you have a kind of like a new form of fast fashion because you could update the clothes that you're wearing with new messages slogans on a daily basis if you wantthis was a project from nike and artifact last year and something that i'm excited about in the farther future is that we won't need to view this extra digital content through our mobile phone it'll actually emit from the smart materials in the fabrics ourselves themselves bywhy do we need digital fashion well today we already spend one third of our time online and as we move into the next generation of the internet known as web three we won't just be on the internet we're actually going to be inside it and just like dollywe we already curate different aspects of who we are for each of the different platforms that we show ourselves on but we're not just going to be two d images insides social media circles or squares anymore we're actually going to be full bodied avatars wereking shopping dating even in three d spacesif you go to south korea the avatar culture is already very well embedded from cape ho brands to digital banking advisors they're kind of everywhere and they have an app called the paso and this is my is a petal avatar here the one in purple this is just a selection of mymy digital twins the avatars that i use on a daily basis and messaging to convey different emotions also to meet friends and go to digital events in three d spaces and you can probably tell that i try to convey different aspects of my personality in my avatars at different trends that iwant to kind of a show and also which tribes i want to belong to but the metaverse that we've all been promised and isn't actually here for a while yet some people are quite excited about that it's not going to be here for awhile yet however is actually the physical fashion sector that could be impacted by digital fashion the mostsome of you might have heard a lot of negative hype and sentiment around any of these non fungible tokens but actually the they are key to the future of digital fashion because they turn a regular file like a j peg into an asset that you can own and that you can trade brands like robertsfood prada and diesel have all done this they've all sold fidgeted items as an f t's for us as consumers this is really good because we can check to see if something is real or authentic before we buy it also once we actually buy it people can see that it's us that owns it on a blockchain and for designers especially emerging ones it helps them protect their designs and each time this piece is resold the designer gets a royalty fee this is going to be a game changer for the fashion sector because it redistributes power and money back towards the originaldesigners and creators but it's not just about creativity and aesthetics digital fashion could also make us be more sustainable one hundred and fifty billion garments are manufactured every year and many of them are unsold this overproduction is unnecessaryand what we need to see morals and i'm talking specifically to you fast fashion retailers is that instead of just relying on previous sales history you actually showcase digital versions of products before you manufacture them u s brand finesse already does this and has no waste in therein processesand however a fashion to that helps you wear that other eighty per cent of your wardrobe save your wardrobe is an amazing tool that digitizes your wardrobe kind of works a little bit like a fitness tracker helps you style outfits together and facilities care and repair so that your items last longanger and it could be a way that you could help reduce the impact of the ninety two million tons of clothing that ends up in landfill each year so the exciting thing is the clueless dream closet is actually already hereand lastly e-commerce return rates within fashion are scarily high between forty to sixty percent and this as a real environmental cost so again how about if retailers helped us try things digitally before we purchase them physically john lewis in the ukuses artificial intelligence to do digital dressing so that consumers can try before they buy and what they've been finding is that people have been trying over eighty items every time they shop and it also makes online shopping much more funlooking to the future by twenty thirty three it's probably likely that you'll have a spotify style subscription to download the latest fashion to wear on your work hologram calls or to flex on your avatar to a virtual gallery opening just another couple of reasons why that wardrobe of yours mighti have a lot less in it thank youthree
