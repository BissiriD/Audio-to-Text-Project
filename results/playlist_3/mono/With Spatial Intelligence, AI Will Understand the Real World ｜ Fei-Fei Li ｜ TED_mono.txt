thelet me show you something to be precise i'm going to show you nothing this was the world five hundred and forty million years ago pure endless darkness it was a dark due to a lack of light it was dark because of alack of sightalthough sunshine did filter a thousand meters beneath the surface of ocean a light permeated from hydrothermal vents to sea floor brimming with life there was not a single eye to be found in these ancient watersthere's no retinas no corneas no lenses so all this light all this life went unseen there was a time that the very idea of seeing didn't exist it was simply never been done before to itwasso for reasons we're only beginning to understand trilobites the first organisms that could sense light emerged that the first inhabitants of this reality that we take for granted first to discover that there's something other than oneselfa world of meaning selvesthe ability to see his thought have ushered a cambrian explosion a period in which a huge variety of animal species entered fossil records what began as a passive experience the simple act of letting light in soon become far more activeof the nervous system began to evolve site turning to incite seeing become understanding understand the lead to actions and all these give rise to intelligence today we're no longersatisfied with just nature's gift of visual intelligence curiosity urges us to create machines to see just as intelligently as we can if not better nine years ago on the stage i delivered an early progress report on computer vision a softfield of artificial intelligence three powerful forces converged for the first time a family of algorithms called neural network fast specialized hardware called graphic processing units or gp use and big data like the fifteen millionimages that my lab spent years curating called image let together that ushered in the age of modern ai we've come a long way back then just putting labels on images were a big breakthrough but the speed and accuracy of these algorithms just improvemoved rapidly at the annual image that challenge led by my lab gauge the performance of these progress and on this pla you're seeing the annual improvement a milestone models we went a step further and created the algorithms that can segmentobjects or predict the dynamic relationships among them in these works done by my students and collaborators and there's more recall last time i showed you the first computer vision algorithm that can describe a photo in human natural language that was whyworked out with my brilliant former student andre capacity at that time i pushed my luck and said andrea can we make computers to do the reverse and andre said haha that's impossible well as you can see from this post recently the impossible has become possible that's thanks to a family of thefusion models that powers today's generative ai algorithm which can take a human prompted sentence and turn turn them into photos or videos of something that's entirely new many of you have seen the recent impressive results of sora by open the eyebut even without the enormous number of gp use my student alara collaborators have developed a generative video model called walled month before sora and you're seeing some of these resultsthere is room for improvement i mean look at that cat's eye the way it goes under the wave without ever getting wet what a catastropheand they've passes the prologue we will learn from these mistakes and create a future we imagine and the in this future we want ai to do everything it can for us or to help us for years i have been saying thattaking a picture is not the same as seeing and understanding today i would like to add to that simply see is not enough seeing is for doing and learning when we act upon this world in three these space and time we learni won't learn to see and do better nature has created this virtuous cycle of seeing and doing powered by spatial intelligence to illustrate to you what your spatial intelligence is doing constantly look at this picture raise your hand if you feel like you want to do somethingin the last split of a second your brain looked at the geometry of this glass it's place in three these are of space it's relationship with a table the cat and everything else and you can predict what's going to happen nextthe urge to act is evening to all beings with spatial intelligence which links perception with action and if we want to advance ai be on it's current capabilities we want more the ai that can see and talk we want aiai that can do indeed we're making exciting progress the recent milestones in spatial intelligence is teaching computers to see learn do and learn to see and do better this is la easy it took nature memillions of years to evolve spatial intelligence which depends on the eye taking light project two d images on the retina and the brain to translate these data into three d information only recently a group of researchers from google are able to develop an algorithm to takea bunch of photos and translate that into three d space like the examples were showing here my student and our collaborators have taken a step further and created an algorithm that takes one input image and turn that into three d shapehere are more examplesrecall we talked about computer programs that can take a human centers and turning to reveals a group of researchers in university of michigan have figured out a way to translate that line of centers into three d room layout like shown hereand my colleagues at stanford their students have developed an algorithm that takes one image and generate infinitely plausible spaces for viewers to explore these are prototypes of the first budding signs of a future possibilityone in which the human race can t can take our entire world and translate into digital forms a model the richness and nuances what nature did to us implicitly in our individual minds spatial intelligence technology can hope to dodo for our collective consciousness as the progress of spatial intelligence accelerates a new era in this virtuous cycle is taking place in front of our eyes this back and forth is catalyzing robotic learning a key component for aany embody intelligence system that needs to understand and interact with the three d worlda decade ago image that from my lab enabled a database of millions of high quality photos to help train computers to see today we're doing the same with behaviors and actions to train computers or robots how to act in the threethe worldbut instead of collecting static images we developed simulation environments powered by three these spatial models so that the computers can have infinite varieties of possibilities to learn to act and you're just seeing some a small number of eggsexamples to teach are robots in a project led by my lab called behavior were also making exciting progress in robotic language intelligence use a large language model based the input my students and our collaborators are among the first team that can showa robotic arm performing a variety of tasks based on verbal instructions like opening this door or unplugging the charged phone or making sandwiches using bread lettuce tomatoes and even putting a napkin for the user typicallyi would like a little more for my sandwich but this is a good startin that primordial ocean in our ancient times the ability to see and perceive one's environment kicked off the cambrian explosion of interactions with other lifeforms today that light is reaching the digital mindsspatial intelligence are allowing machines to interact not only with one another but with humans have with three the world real or virtual and as that future is taking shape it'll have a profound impact too many lives let's take healthcareas an example for the past decade my lab has been taking some of the first steps in applying ai to tackle challenges that impact patient outcome and medical staff burnout together with our collaborators from stanford school of medicine and partnering hospitalswere piloting smart sensors that can detect clinicians go into patient rooms without properly washing their hands or keep track of surgical instruments or alert care teams when a patient is at physical risk such as fallingwe consider these techniques a form of ambient intelligence like an extra pairs of eyes that do make a difference but i would like more interactive help for our patients clinicians and caretakers who desperately also need an extra pair of handsimagine autonomous robot transporting medical supplies while caretakers focus our patients or augmented reality guiding surgeons to do safer faster and less invasive operations or imagined patients with severe paralysiscontrolling robots with their thoughts that's why brainwaves to perform everyday tasks that you and i take for granted you're seeing a glimpse of that future in this pilot study from my lab recently in this video the robotic arm is cooking the japanese sukiyaki meal controlled only by the brain electrical signal non invasively collected through a eg capthough the emergence of vision half a billion years ago turned a world of darkness upside down it set off the most profound evolutionary process the development of intelligence in animal worldas breathtaking progress in the last decade is just as astounding but i believe the full potential of this digital cambrian explosion won't be fully realized until we power of our computers and and robots with spatial intelligenceit's just like what later did to all of usit's exciting time to teach our digital companion to learn to reason and to interact with this beautiful three the space we call home and also create many more new worlds that we can all explore to realize this future won't be easy it requiresas all of us to take thoughtful steps and develop technologies that always put humans in the center but if we do this right the computers or robots powered by spatial intelligence will not only be useful tools but also trusted partners to inhas an augment our productivity and humanity while respecting our individual dignity and lifting our collective prosperity what excites me the most in the future is a future in which that ai grows more perceptive insightful andspatially aware and they join us on our quest to always pursue a better way to make a better world thank youthree
