the you know when i was a kid dreaming about the amazing future that computers could bring i never thought it would look like this i snapped this photo in line at chipotle thinking man what has the world come toeveryone stuck in their phones all the time and then i almost doubled over laughing at myself because there i am stuck in my phone being judged about these people stuck in theirs the truth is that we could all benefit from a little less screen time and so how do we push back and create a healthier relationship tooour technology i've been trying to figure out what comes next what's the technology that we want to be using i spent three years funding deep tech at rp ii and then i moved to google x google's moonshot factory before creating a spin out called io the last ten years diligently and some may saya obsessively trying to peek beyond the curve what i think is next is that we need an entirely new kind of computer one that speaks our language instead of forcing us to speak their language of swipes and clicksa computer that we can talk to and not in the way that you speak at siri with loud robotic voice commands but in the way that we talk with each other so genuine engaging conversation so a new kind of natural language computing built on a new kind ofcompute hardwareso we've been building this new kind of computer in secret for six years now and today is the first time that we're talking about it publicly so this is a prototype audio computer as we call them and the first thing that you'll see is they don't have a screen we've got perfectly good screens in our pockets and we're hoping that we canleave them there or even at home a little bit more often so these are not just fancy looking earbuds they're an entire computer and we think they're going to replace some of what we do with the visual computers that were used to we've created a new audio based user interface which relies on natural language as the inputand what we call auditory space as the output and we're hoping that these innovations will help us create a new kind of relationship with computers where the io is more natural more intuitive so you can just talk have a natural language conversation with all kinds of different powerful audio apps so hereis a really simple examplehey q hi jason how are you doing i'm good i'm doing the ted talk right nowyou got this jason how can i support youi dunno you know i'm nervous talking in front of this many people yeah i know you don't like public speaking how can i helpi guess i could use a little bit of encouragementdo you want me to share a positive message from a loved one yeah that'd be great maybe just one i don't want to bore people your dad texted good luck today jason i'm so proud of youthat's awesome thanks q can you tell him i said thanks and tell him i'm up on stage right now he'll get a kick out of that no problemso any suggestions for how i can loosen up a little bitdo you want to hear a joke to lighten the moodokay yeah maybe if it's on theme do you know any tech startup jokes how many startup founders does it take to change a light bulbi dunno tell meonly one he just holds it in place and the world revolves around himhuhokay sick burn i'm going to get back to the talk here so you see the difference between those robotic voice commands and just a conversation natural language is just more natural it's intuitive it's better so what makes this kind of conversationpossibleit's the single most revolutionary breakthrough in the history of information technologydon't worry i'm not talking about our devices although they're pretty cool and i don't mean ella limbs either which are obviously a building block herewhat i'm talking about is something much olderit's the first uniquely human form of communication the one that we naturally learn as children and has it's structure built into our brain very thing i'm doing right now talkingspoken language emerged in tandem with the evolution of human consciousness and to this day it remains our most efficient and emotionally robust form of communication conversation is not just transmitting ideas from one person to another it's more like thinking togethermodern neuroscientists have pioneered a whole new approach to the brain it's called second person neuroscience and it's built on the notion that how we think is not isolated it's collective and it happens out loud not just through words but through subtle signals of tone and prosody your tomba and your pitch and intensityand neuroscience is just not complete until you add a second person into this full social dynamic so why can't we have a computer that we can talk with in that way with that kind of natural languagea computer that has superhuman processing speed and it has access to the internet and it's been trained on the entire written record of human thoughtbut engages with you like a person would that understands your intention and that taps into the superpower of human natural language understandingthat's the promise of audio computing so think about not just how it can replace many of the things that you do on your phone but actually make them better so take email for example we pull out our phones we swipe or scroll we furiously type with our thumbs wouldn't it be better to just sit back with a cup of coffee and be briefed inconversation or search search is a big one it's an incredible technology that made the world a radically better place but with these audio computers you can just talk out loud about anything that you want to know it just feels so normal so there's a big difference between givesa voice command to one of the big five voice assistants which are the structured predefined choose your own adventure dialogue models that we all have to learn and i'm sure have all felt that frustrationand just having a real conversation these natural language applications can get to know you in the same way that we get to know each other they build context about our lives just through us talking over time so later take out your phone look at all those apps all those candy colored icons and think about how could you accomplish the same thingbut through conversation or how could you make it better you won't be able to do instagram or tiktok those apps whose content is mostly visual but wouldn't it be better to spend a little bit less time in those apps or just need your screen a little bit less so our goal is to be heads up and hands free for a littlebit more of the day you just get back into the world of course if the auditory user interface or the ai as we call it is going to really integrate into your life it has to feel private and convenient to use so that's why we built it as an all day wearable for the ear but your ears are for hearing first and foremost andso if you're going to wear a computer on them all day we can't mess that up in fact we should probably make that better too so these audio computers over the last six grueling years of r and d became a sort of mixed reality device it's like the apple vision pro but for audio where we can pass throughoh and we can modify your ambient acoustics giving you an unprecedented control over your personal soundscape in order to do mixed audio reality we sorta had to hack the auditory system to be able to display sound in ultra high fidelity spatially as if it's all around you so there's this whole field of researchit's called psycho acoustics which we've bled on for years we built this giant audio structure it's a dome with one hundred and twenty eight customs speakers coming from all directions so we could create virtual soundscapes it's sort of like the star trek holodeck but for audio and if you're standing in the middle of this and you close your eyeswe can transport you auditorily to anywhere that we want so we can render a virtual football game and you feel the energy or we can make it sound like you're in the middle of a bustling city street and if you're me you feel the anxiety or standing on a beach with the crashing wavesand you feel the peaceand so it's super cool i wish everyone could be inside there then we ran countless experiments to figure out all the complicated ways that your brain position sounds in space also we could reverse engineer those neural algorithms and code them into our software so our goal has been to create this experiencebut right herea psycho acousticians call this virtual auditory space to distinguish from our real auditory space which is you know the sounds that are all around us and this is what's necessary to create a compelling mixed audio reality device so it's actually impossible to demonstrate this experience until you hear it with your ears yourself but to give youwe have tried to simulate it for you so imagine that you're sitting in a noisy restaurant and you're having trouble hearing your friends across the tablethe can you enhance sounds that are right in front of mewtfand that can you turn that baby down a littlethat's better than still having a little trouble hearing pedro can you isolate pedro formatgame he displays monica mossthat's perfect and my spanish is a little rusty can i hear pedro but in englishand at the end of the trip we came back to the city to visit the historic center where shelter was all programsit's so much worse okay that's pretty cool right that's pretty coolhey so what you just heard was a beam forming up the computational auditory scene analysis app a machine learning the noise ing out and ai transcription and translation and text-to-speech with style transfer app the point is that all those audio transformations are done by software so we think the possibilitythese for these audio computers are pretty much endless and we can't wait to see what the world's developers are going to do here like imagine an education app that knows your personal learning style and can teach you with the quality of a world class professor on call anytime or like a fitness coach you can summon all day about your diet and exerciseyou can also motivate you through conversation and even get gamify your workout with some auditory cues or an akhi jason what's up hey if you were going to make an audio app that could be anything what would it behow about a whoopee cushion that plays a fart sound whenever you sit downokay if you were going to make an audio app that didn't have anything to do with farts what would it bemaybe an app that generates personalized soundscapes for relaxation and focus as much better alright it looks like we still have a little fine tuning to do hereso the point is imagination is the only limit to what you can do here our goal is not just to create the world's first audio computer is to create a truly intuitive computing experience where we're not monetizing your attention or making you captive to a newkind of device but instead interfacing machines with us in the way that we were born toso i think it's time for a computer that speaks our language thank youthree
