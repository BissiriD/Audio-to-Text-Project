thewhen i was a student studying robotics a group of us decided to make a presence for our professor's birthday we wanted to program our robots to cut a slice of cake for himwe pulled an all nighter writing the software and the next day disaster we programmed this robots to cart a soft round sponge cake but we didn't coordinate well and instead we received a square hard ice cream cake the robot flailed wildly and thenearly destroyed the cakeour professor was delighted anyway he calmly pushed the stop buttonand declared the erratic behavior of the robot a console singularity a robotics technical termi was disappointed but i learned a very important lesson the physical world with it's physics laws and in precision is a far more demanding space than the digital worldtoday i leads mit's computer science and ai lab the largest research unit at mit this is our building where i work with brilliant and brave researchers to invent the future of computing and intelligent machinestoday in computing artificial intelligence and robotics are largely separate fieldsai has amazed you with his decision making and learning but it remains confined inside computers robots have a physical presence and can execute preprogrammed tasks but they're not intelligent while this separation is starting to change ai is about to break freefree from the to the computer screen interactions and enter a vibrant physical three d worldin my lab refusing the digital intelligence of ai with a mechanical prowess of robots moving air from the digital world into the physical world is making machines intelligence and leading to the next great breakthrough what i call physical intelligencephysical intelligence is when a eyes power to understand text images and other online information is used to make real world machines smarter this means ai can help reprogrammed robots do their tasks better by using knowledge from datawith physical intelligence ai doesn't just reside in our computers but works rolls flies and interacts with us in surprising ways imagine being surrounded by helpful robots at the supermarket the one on the left can help you carry a heavy boxyeahto make it happen we need to do a few things we need to rethink how machines think we need to reorganize how they are designed and how they learnso for physical intelligence ai has to run on computers that fit on the body of the robot for example our soft robot fish today's ai uses server farms that do not fittoday's ai also makes mistakes this ai system on a robot card does not detect pedestriansfor physical intelligence we need small brains that do not make mistakeswe're tackling these challenges using inspiration from a worm called c elegancein sharp contrast to the billions of neurons in the human brain see elegance has a happy life on only three hundred two neurons and biologists understand the math of what each of these neurons doso here's the idea can we build ai using inspiration from the mass of these neuronswe have developed together with my collaborators and as students a new approach to ai we call liquid networks and liquid networks results in much more compact and explainable solutions than today's traditional ai solutions let me show you this is our self driving carit's trained using a traditional ai solution the kind you find in many applications today this is the dashboard of the car in the lower right corner you'll see the map in the upper left corner the camera inputstream and the big box in the middle with a blinking lights is the decision making engine it constcysts of tens of thousands of artificial neurons and it decides how the car should steer it is impossible to correlate the activity of these neurons with the behavior of the car moreover if you look at the lower left side you see where in the image this decision making engine looks to tellthe car what to do and you see how noisy it is and this car drives by looking at the bushes and the trees on the side of the road that's not how we drive people look at the road now contrast this with our liquid network solution which consists of only nineteen neurons rather than tens of thousandsand look at it's attention map it's so clean and focused on the road horizon and the side of the roadbecause these models are so much smaller we actually understand how they make decisionsso how did we get this performancewell in a traditional ai system the computational neuron is the artificial neuron and the artificial neuron is essentially an on off computational unit it takes in some numbers adds the map apply some basic math and passes along the result and this is complex because it happens across thousands of computational yearsunits in liquid networks we have fewer neurons but each one does more complex math here's what happens inside our liquid neuron we use differential equations to model the neural computation and the artificial synapse and these differential equations are what biologists have mapopt for the neural structure of the worms we also wire the neurons differently to increase the information flow while these changes yield phenomenal results traditional ai systems are frozen after training that means they cannot continue to improve when we deploy them in a physicalthe world in the wild we just wait for the next releasebecause of what's happening inside the liquid neuron liquid networks continue to adapt after training based on the inputs that they see let me show youwe trained traditional ai and liquid networks using summertime videos like these once and that the task was to find things in the woods all the models learn how to do the task in the summer then we tried to use the models on drones in the fall the traditional ai solution gets confused bythe background look at the attention map cannot do the task liquid networks do not get confused by the background and very successfully execute the task so this is it this is the step forward ai that adapts after trainingliquid networks are important because they give us a new way of getting machines to think that is rooted into physics models a new technology for ai we can run them on smartphones on robots an enterprise computers and even on new types of machines that weekcan now begin to imagine and design the second aspect of physical intelligence so by now you've probably generated images using text to image systems we can also do texts the robot but not using today's ai solutions because they work on statistics and do not understand physics in mymy lab we developed an approach that guides the design process by checking and simulating the physical constraints for for the machine we start with a language prompt make me a robot that can walk forward and our system generates the designs including shape materials and alactuators sensors the program to control it and the fabrication files to make it and then the designs gets refined in simulation until they meet the specifications so in a few hours we can go from idea to controllable physical machinewe can also do image to robot this photo can be chance that transformed into a cuddly robotic bunny to do so our algorithm computer three d representation of the photo that gets sliced and folded printed then we fold the printed layers with string some morrison saysanswers we write some code and we get the body you've seen this videowe can use this approach to make anything almost from an image from a photoso the ability to do to transform text into images and to transform images into robots is important because we are drastically reducing the amount of time and the resources needed to prototype and test new products and this is allowing for a much faster innovationcycleand now we are ready to even make the leap to get these machines to learn the third aspect of physical intelligencethese machines can learn from humans how to do tasks you can think of it as human to robot in my lab we created a kitchen environment where we instrument people with sensors and we collect a lot of data about how people do kitchen tasks and we need physical data because videos do not capture the dinerof the task so we collect muscle pose even gaze information about how people do tasks and then we train ai using this data to teach robots how to do the same tasks and the end result is machines that move with grace and agility as well as a dhdapt and learn physical intelligencewe can use this approach to teach robots how to do a wide range of tasks food preparation cleaning and so much morethe ability to turn images and texts into functional machines coupled with using liquid networks to create powerful brains for these machines that can learn from humans is incredibly exciting because this means we can make almost anything we imaginetoday's ai has a ceiling it requires server farms it's not sustainable it makes in inexplicable mistakes let's not settle for the current offering when ai moves into the physical world the opportunities for benefits and for breakthroughs is extraordinaryyou can get personal assistance that optimize your routines and anticipate your needs bespoke machines that help you at work and robots that delight you in your spare time the promise of physical intelligence is to transcend our human limitations with capabilityis that extend our reach amplify our strength and refine our precision and grant us ways to interact with a world with only dreamed ofwe are the only species so advanced so aware so capable of building these extraordinary tools yet developing fused physical intelligence is teaching us that we have so much more to learn about technology and about ourselves we need human guiding hands over aisooner rather than later after all we remain responsible for this planet and everything living on it i remain convinced that we have the power to use physical intelligence to ensure a better future for humanity and for the planet and i'd like to invite you to help us in this casewest some of you will help develop physical intelligence some of you will use it and some of you will invent the future thank youthree
