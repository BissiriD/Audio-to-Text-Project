thecatching cancer it's earliest stages when it's most treatable can save countless livesbut the million dollar question as an otherwise healthy body made up of trillions of cells how can we zero in on a small group of rogue cancer cells the answer i think maybe rooted in something that thanks to the pandemic may have all come to know quite well and that is irony i think these days everyone has a basic understanding ofhow learning works again thanks to the corporate vaccines but basically arnis transcribed from dna in the cell and messenger army specifically serves as a template for protein synthesis so usually the more amarna you are having to sell the more protein you getbut how discovery is a little bit differentyeah found a new class of ironies that i've changed how we think about cancer detection these are relatively small earnings and they don't actually code for any protein non-coding and since we found them we got to name them and we have called them orphan noncoding ironies are on carney's for surethese one carnies have not only changed and transformed our approach to cancer detection from blood non-invasively but i've also they've also helped open a window into the tumor itself for us so leveraging these arnis we are not only detecting cancer earlier we are actually appearing in suits biologyso without that short introduction let me breakdown designs for youas you may know every sending our body shares the same genetic code as every other cell it's as if our cells have access to the same pine tree but then they use different recipes to mix the same ingredients into different dishes it's actually the diversity in genomic recipes that gives us the more than two onehundred cell types will be having our bodies each with their own distinct role and function like skin cells for example or neurons and as you can imagine there is a complex machinery in placing the cell that governs this process and tells the cell for each of it's twenty thousand genes how much of them we need to exxpress to be a healthy well functioning cell now cancer cells being that resourceful survivalist that they are they actually hijack components of this machinery to their advantage and they do this to increase the expression of genes that will help the twomore grow and spread throughout the body or a silence or downregulated genes whose job is to keep cancer in checkanother way of putting this is that cancer cells are basically hacking that original genomic recipe that i told you aboutnow a few years ago we made an interesting discovery that is actually a consequence of this genomics reprogramming that happens in cancer cells is actually a hallmark of cancer basically parts of the genome that is normally silent and inactive in healthy cells becomeactivated in cancerand a direct consequence of this activation is the birth of a new kind of ironythat we only see these are nice in cancer but not really in healthy cellsnow over the past few years yeah i've spent a lot of time basically mapping these cancer emergent ironies across human cancers and as i told you earlier you have come to name them on carney'snow what is even more interesting is that which one carnies i see in a given sample is not random it's actually tied back to the type or subtype of cancer i'm looking at so collectively on carney's actually provide digital molecular barcodethat captures cancer cell identity and is actually unique to the type or subtype of cancerbut how are these micro barcodes actually usefulso it turns out on carnies are actually are not actually confined to cancer cells some of them are nicely packaged and released into the blood and this is something that healthy cells do is roll with other smaller ironies and with all of these introduction i hope you know where i'm going with this basically if on carnies are only expressed in cashourselves and some of them do in fact find their way into the bloodstream doesn't it mean that we should be able to detect them in blood samples from cancer patients the answer it turns out is yes but with an asteriskso the oncogenes that we detect in blood samples from patients actually form a partial barcode and it's only a partial bar code because only a subset among current a's are actually secreted from cancer cells into the blood and even a smaller subset can be reliably detected in this small volume of blood howeverthanks to the magic of machine learning and ai we can actually use this partial information to reconstruct the original barcode that resides in the tumor and we can match that construction against our catalog of ancona barcodes across cancer to not only across cancer is not to not only detect hppresence of the disease but also identify it's type or subtype and actually as we grow fundamentally increase the number of these on current catalogues that we have built we can go deeper and deeper into the biology of the disease as wellnow with help from our clinical collaborators that use csf we have come a step closer to actually bringing this platform to the clinic in a preliminary study across to one hundred breast cancer patients you have actually shown that we can use on carnage to detect residual disease in patients after everyreceive treatment and knowing which patients have remaining disease tells conditions who needs additional treatment or monitoring after the surgery and this way patients receive more treatment only when it's neededi truly believe that the next decade is the decade of cancer screening and as you can imagine blood detection of cancers is a major frontier in that war and i hope to have convinced you today that leveraging powerful ai built on top of molecular barcodes are on carney's we can endvision of future that precise and sensitive but more importantly very accessible blood detection of cancers is not just a hope but is actually a reality thank youthree
