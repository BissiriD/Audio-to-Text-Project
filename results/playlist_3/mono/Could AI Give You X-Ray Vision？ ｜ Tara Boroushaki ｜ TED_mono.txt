theas a teenager i was fascinated with the visiting world i wanted to be like hermione granger i wanted to be a powerful witch with a wandout of all the spells i really liked accu i could say accu a name anything and it will fly into my hands even if it's a restricted both locked and hidden inside the headmaster's officebut as you might have noticed i did not getting to hogwartsso i came to my backup school miti made my own magici can now i can have his spells now that are even more powerful than her my knees because i don't need a wandi can see the invisiblelet me show you my first spellfor example i want to find my black shirt in my closet that i lost i put on my ar headset and i say accuwe didn't matter of seconds my shirt bit lighterlike i said i can see the invisiblelaughsso how does this spell work how did i may than a ar headset able to see what my own eyes cannot seemy trick is to use wireless signals like bluetooth and wifi this signals are great this is exactly why you can get wifi from another roomso these signals are sent by these headsets they are scattered in the warm and they go through boxes and then are onreflected back from all of these hidden objects including my shirtwe didn't design algorithms that uses these reflected signals to find these objects let me show you how these algorithms workfirst the headsets tries to understand it's environment by creating a virtual treaty mapand then as i walk in the mormon it keeps sending these wireless signals tries to collect all of the reflections and then combines them to collect and collect collect this information and then tries to locate the object that i was looking for then after sometimes it becomes confident about it and then tells mehere it is this is the globe which is where the object i want is and i can go and grab itbesides helping me having these magical powers it has a lot of industrial applications for example in a warehouse it can help warehouse worker to find packages and then it can guide them through the warehouse to find his packagesin retail store it can help the store associates to park customers order and find misplaced itemsit also has a lot of photo application in logistics and manufacturingso having an x ray vision is very cool it's better than what hermione had but sometimes i'm just so lazy i don't want to go ahead put my headset on and then say akio and then go and find my key grab it under the pile so it was thinking what if i had a robotnot that new my spellso i taught my spells to a robotmy robot can find my keys and bring them to me let me show it to you for example here my keychain is hidden under the pile in the basketmy robot is able to search the environment and locate my keys with centimeter level accuracy purposefully declutter the environment and then grab the keys and bring them to meso how did we do thiswe built in a specialized gripper instead of a wandso it has a camera and a wireless sensor which sends a similar signals like the headset adjust taco bellso this is great now disc reaper can locate the keysbut there's one challenge what if i put my robot in a completely new environment for example put it in the living room and ask it to find a remote controlhow does this robot adapts itself to completely new environment and a completely new object if the robot does exactly the same steps as before then it can only find a key in a basketwe design ai algorithms specifically to help this robot to adapt itself to completely new environment and find object this has never seen beforefor example here is trying to find a remote control on a couch in your living room and has never seen before it's able to find it and then bring it to me and i can go and grab this remote control and then watch my favorite showmagical x-ray vision can change the way we think about our environment and the way we interact with our environment it opens up new possibilities that we never thought there are possible for example it can help our future robots inour homes to help us it can also help us interact with our future smartphones in ways we never imagined beforebut the application that i'm personally very excited about is helping our first responders to find and track humans in conditions with low visibility or helping humans under the rubble after disaster hitsand as the cherry on top it can help those of us who did not get into hogwarts to get one step closer to the abuser lng world thank youthree
