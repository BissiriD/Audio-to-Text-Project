theand it's so good to have you here it's fantastic to be here thanks chris now you told time magazine i want to understand the big questions the really big ones that you normally go into philosophy or physics if you're interested in them i thought building a i would be the fastest route to answer some of those questionswhy did you think thatwell when i was at i guess when i was a kid my my favorite subject was physics and i was in shit and all the big questions fundamental nature of reality what is consciousness all the all the big ones and usually you going to physics if you're injured or not but i read a lot of the great physicists some of my all time scientific heroes like feynman and so onand i realize in the last twenty thirty years we haven't made much progress in understanding some of these fundamental laws so i thought why not build the ultimate tool to help us which is artificial intelligence and at the same time we could also maybe better understand ourselves and the brain better by doing that too so not only was an incredible toolis also useful for some of the big questions itself super interesting so obviously a i can do so many things but i think for this conversation i'd love to focus in on this theme of what it might do to unlock the really big questions the giant scientific breakthroughs because it's been such a theme driving you and your commsfunny yeah so i mean one of the big things ai can do and i've always thought about is where we're getting even back twenty thirty years ago the beginning of the internet era and computer era and the amount of data that was being produced and also scientific data just too much for the human mind to comprehend in some many cases and ione of the uses of ai is to find patterns and insights in huge amounts of data and then surface that to the human scientists to to make sense of them make new hypotheses and conjectures so it seems to me very compatible with the scientific method right but gameplay has played a huge role in your own journey and figuring this thing out hereawesome who is this young lad on the left there who is less so that was me i think it must be about ron nine years old i'm captaining the england under eleven team and we're playing it in a four nations tournaments why we are all in red thing we're playing france scotland and wales i think it was that is so weirdyes that happened to me tooin my dreams risethis is okay so you were and it wasn't just chelsea you were you loved all kinds of game i love those kinds of games yeah and when you launched deep mind pretty quickly you startedhaving a tackle gameplay why why well look i'm in games actually got me into ai in the first place because while we were doing things like we used to go in training camps where the england team and so on and actually back then i guess it was in the mid eighties and we would use the very early chest computers if you remember them as train onto the train againjust as well as playing against each other and they weren't big lumps of plastic physical boards that used to some of you remember used to actually press the the the the squares down and they were l e d lights came on and i remembered actually not just thinking about the chest hours actually just fascinated by the fact that this lump of plastic someone had programmed it to besmart and actually play chess to a really high standard and i was just amazed by that and that got me thinking about thinking and how does this how does the brain come up with these thought processes these ideas and then maybe how we could mimic that with computers so yeah it's been a whole theme for for my whole life really but you areraised all this money to to launch deep mind and pretty soon you were using it to do for example this so i mean this is an odd use of it what was going on here where we started off with games at the beginning of deep months back in two thousand and ten so this is for about ten years ago is our first big breakthrough because i the we stayarticle with classic atari games from the nineteen seventies the simplest kind of computer games that are out there and one of the reasons we use games is they're very convenient to do to to to test out your ideas and your algorithms that really fast to test and also as your systems get more powerful you can choose harder and harder gamesthis was actually the first time ever that our machines surprised us the first of many times which it figured out in this game called breakout that you could send the ball round the back of the wall and actually it'd be much safer way to knock out all the tiles of the walls as a classic atari game there and that was our first real aha moment so this thing was not programmed to have any stratabudgie it was just told try and figure out a way of winning you just move the but it a fifth you can find a way of winning right it was a real revolution at the time this was in two thousand and twelve two thousand and thirteen where we caught we coined these terms deep reinforcement learning and the key thing about the knows that those systems were learning directly from the pixels the raw pixels on the screenbut they aren't being told anything else so there we to maximize the score here the pixels on the screen thirty thousand pixels and you got it the system has to make sense on it's own from first principles what's going on what is controlling how to get points unless the other nice thing about using games to begin with they have clear objectives to win to get scoresyou can kind of measure very easily and that your systems are improving but there was a direct line from that to this moment a few years later where the country of south korea and many other parts of asia and in fact the world went crazy over have a walk yeah so this was the pinnacle of this is in twenty sixteen the pinnacle of ourgames playing work were so we'd done atari we we we've done some more complicated games and then we reached the pinnacle which was the game of go which is what they play in asia instead of chess but it's actually more complex than chess and the the the the the actual brute force algorithms that we used to dokind of crack chess were not possible with go because it's a much more pattern based game much more intuitive game so even though deep blue beat carey caspar in the nineties it take took another twenty years for our program alphago to beat the world champion at go and we always thought myself and the and the people working on this project for many years ifyou could build a system that could beat the world champion at go he would have had to have done something very interesting and in this case what we did with alphago is a basic he learned for itself by playing millions and millions of games against itself ideas about go the right strategies and in fact invented his own new strategies that the go world had never seen before even though we'veplayed go for more than two thousand years it's the oldest board game in existence so it was pretty astounding not only did it win the match and it also came up with brand new strategiesand you continued this with with a new strategy of not even really teaching anything about go but just setting up systems that just from first principles would would play so that they could teach themselves from scratch go or chess talk about alpha zero and the amazing thing that happened in in chessso following this the alphago started we start with alphago by giving it all of the human games that being played on the internet so it started that as a basic starting point for its knowledge and then we wanted to see what would happen if we started from scratch from literally random play so this is what alpha zero was that's why it's the zero in that in the name because it startwith zero prior knowledge and the reason we did that is because then we would build a system that was more general so alphago could only play go but alpha zero could play any to play game and it did it by playing an initially randomly and then slowly incrementally improving while not very slowly actually within the course of twenty four hourhours going from random to better than world champion leveland so this is so amazing to me so i'm more familiar with chess than go and thought decades thousands and thousands of ai experts worked on building incredible chess computers eventually they got better than humans you had a moment a few years ago where in nine hours alpha zero taught itself to playhs better than any of those systems ever did to talk about that it was pretty incredible moment actually so we said it going on chess and and as he said there's this rich history of chess and ai where they read these expert systems that been programmed with these chests ideas chess algorithms andyou start you have this amazing i remembered this diary clearly sort of sit down with the system starting off random in the morning you go for a cup of coffee you come back i can still just about beat it by lunchtime maybe just about and then you let it go for another four hours and by dinner it's the it's the greatest chess playing entity that's ever existedand you know it's quite amazing like looking that live on something that you know well you know like chess and you're expert in and actually just seeing that in front of your eyes and then you extrapolate to what it could then do in science or something else which of course games were only a means to an end they were never the end in themselves they were just the training ground forour ideas and to make quick progress in a matter of you know less than five years actually went from atari two to go yeah i mean this is why people are in or have a i also kind of terrified by it and it's not just incremental improvement the fact that in a few hours you can achieve what millionsof humans over centuries have not been able to achieve that that is just that gives you pause for thought i mean it is us i mean it's a hugely powerful technology it's going to be incredibly transformative and we have to be very thoughtful about how we use that capability so to talk about this use of it because this is again this is another extension ofthe the work you've done one now you're turning it to something incredibly useful for the world what what are all the letters on the left and what's in the right yeah so this is shower and this was always my aim with ai from from a kid which is to to use it to accelerate scientific discovery and actually ever since and during my undergrad at cambridge i had this problem in mind one dayeffect for ai is called the protein folding problem and it's kind of like a fifty year grand challenge in biology and and it's very simple to explain proteins are essential to life they're the building blocks of life everything in your body depends on proteins and you describe a protein protein sort of described by it's amino acid sequence which you can think ofis roughly the genetic sequence describing the party each of the letters and each of those letters represents in itself of a complex molecule that's right each of those letters an amino acid and you can think of them as a car you can think of as a kind of string of beads there at the bottom left right and and but in nature in your body or in an animal this string a sequence toone's into this beautiful shape on the right that's the protein that's that those letters describe that shape and that's what that's what it looks like in nature and the important thing about that three d structure is that the three d structure of the protein goes a long way to telling you what it's function is in the body what it does and so the protein folding problem is can you directly predictthe three d structure just from the amino acid sequence so literally they give the machine the ai system to the letters on the left can produce the three d structure on the right and alpha folders are presented as it's not calculating it from the letters it's looking at patterns of other folded program proteins that unknown about the thingand somehow learning from those patterns yes may be the way to do so so when we started this project to actually straight off the alphago i thought we were ready once we once we'd crack go i felt we were finally ready after almost twenty years of working on this stuff to actually tackle some scientific problems clearing protein folding and what we start with isand painstaking over the last forty plus years experimental biologists have a piece together around one hundred and fifty thousand protein structures raising very complicated you know x ray crystallography techniques and other complicated experimental techniques and the rule of thumb is that it takes one phd studenttheir whole phd so for five years to uncover one structure but there are two hundred million proteins known to nature so you could just you know just take forever to do that and so we managed to actually fold using alpha fold in one year all those two hundred million proteins known to science so that's a billion years a phd thoughthis is amazing to me just how reliably it works and the the on the the shows here's the model and you do the experiment and sure enough the protein turns out the same way time and two hundred million yeah and the and the more you deeply go into proteins you just start appreciating howexquisite they army look at how beautiful these proteins on each of these things do a special function in in nature and they're almost like works of art and it still astounds me today that alpha fold can predict the green is the ground truth and the blue is the prediction of how how well it can predict is to within the width of an atom on average is is how accurate the prediction is which iswhat is needed for biologists to use it and for drug design and for disease understanding which is what will alpha forward unlocks you made a surprising decision which was to give away the actual results of your two hundred million projectwe we open-sourced alpha forward and gave everything away on a huge database with our wonderful colleagues the european bioinformatics institutethen you're you're part of google was that was there a phone calls a dennis woman what did you just do or what we know i'm lucky we have very supportive google really supportive of science and and understand the benefits this can bring to the world and you know the argument here was thatwe could only ever have even scratched the surface of the potential of what we could do with this is you know maybe like a millionth of of what the scientific community is doing with it is that there's over a million and a half biologists around the world have used alfa phone as predictions we think that's almost every biologist in the world is is making use of this now every farmer company so we'll we'll never knowprobably what the full impact of it all is but you're continuing this work in a new company that spinning out google called isom of islamophobia a symbol of it and give us just a sense of the vision that was the vision so alpha fold is is a sort of fundamental biology tool like how do you know what are these three d structures and then whatmight they do in nature and then if you you know the reason i thought about this and was so excited about this is as is the this is the beginnings of understanding disease and also may be helpful for for designing drugs so if you know the shape of the protein and then you can kind of figure out which part of the surface of theprotein you are going to target with your drug compounds and isomorphic is extending this what we did in alpha fold into the chemistry space where we can divine design chemical compounds that will bind exactly to the right spot on the protein and also importantly to nothing else in the body so so it doesn't have any side effectsand it's not toxic and so on and we're building many other ai models sort of system models to alpha fold to help predict make predictions in chemistry space so we can expect to see some pretty dramatic health medicine breakthroughs in the coming few years i think we will be able to get down drug discovery from years to maybe monthsokay dumb as i'd like to change direction a bitour mutual friend worry gave a talk last year at ted ai that she called the moloch trap moloch trop is is a situation whereorganizations companies in a competitive situation can be driven to do things that no individual running those companies would by themselves do and it's it's felt i was really struck by this organise felt as a sort of lay person observer that the moloch top has been shockinglyin effect in the last couple of years so here you are with deep mindset of pursuing these amazing medical breakthroughs and scientific breakthroughs and then suddenly kind of out of left field and openai openai with marks of releases chart pt and the world goes crazy and then it goes holycrop areas is you know everyone can use it and and there's a sort of them it felt like the moloch trepanation i think marks of ceos such in actually said google is the eight hundred pound gorilla in the search space we werewanted to make google dance and howand it did google did not so it was a dramatic response and your role was changed you took over the whole google ai effort product so rushed out and gemini some part amazing part embarrassing i'm not going to ask you out gemini because you've addressed elsewhere but but it's it feelsthis was the moloch crap happening that you and others were pushed to do stuff that you wouldn't have done without this sort of catalyzing competitive thing metre did something similar while they rushed out an open source versions of ai which is arguably a reckless act in itselfthis seems terrifying to me why is it terrifying look it's a complicated topic of course and and first of all i mean there are many things to say about it first of all we be we were working on many large language models and in fact obviously google research actually invented transformers as you know which is thearchitecture that allowed all this to be possible and five six years ago and so we had many large models internally the thing was i think what the chachi pt moment did that change was and fair play to them to do that was they demonstrated i think somewhat surprisingly to themselves as well that the public were ready to you know the genthe public are ready to embrace these systems and actually find value in these systems impressive though they are we i guess when we are working on these systems mostly you're focusing on the flaws and the things they don't do and hallucinations and things you're familiar with now we're thinking you know would anyone really find that useful given that it does this and that and the other and we wanted to employmove those things first before putting them out but interestingly it turned out that even with those flaws many tens of millions of people still find them very useful and so that was an interesting update on maybe the convergence of products and the science that actually and all of these amazing things we've been doingthe lab so to speak are actually ready for prime time for general use and beyond the rarefied world of science and i think that's pretty exciting in many ways so at the moment we've got this exciting array of products which we're all enjoying all this generative ai stuff is amazing but let's roll the clock forward a bit and microsoft andopen ai are reported to be building or investing like one hundred billion dollars into an absolute monster database supercomputer that can offer computer orders of magnitude more than anything we have today i think the it takes like five gigawatts of energy to drive thisit's estimated that the energy of new york city to drive a data center so we're pumping all this energy into this giant va spray you google i presume is going to match this type of investment like what we mean we don't talk about our specific numbers but we're you know i think we're investing more than that over over time soand that's one of the reasons we we teamed up with google back in two thousand and fourteen as we we were kind of we knew that in order to get to a dea we would need a lot of compute and that's what's transpired and google had and still has the most computers so so earth is building these giant computers that are going to base his giant brains that are going to power so much of the futureeconomyand it's all it's it's by companies that are in competition with each other how how will we avoid the situation where someone is getting a lead someone else has got one hundred billion dollars invested in that thing isn't someone going to go wait a sec if we used reinforcement learning here to maybewe have the ai tweak its own code and rewrite itself and make it so power we might be able to catch up in nine hours of the weekend with what they're doing roll the dice summit we have no choice otherwise we're going to lose a fortune for our show us how how are we going to avoid that yet what we must avoid that cause caylee and my view is thatas we get closer to eiji i we need to collaborate more and the the good news is that that most of the scientists involved in these labs know each other very well and we talk to each other a lot at conferences and other things and this technology is still relatively nascent so probably it's okay what's happening at the moment but as we get closerto ai i think as as a society we need to start thinking about the types of architectures that get built so i'm very optimistic of course that's why i spent my whole life on on working on ai and working towards a g i but i'm i suspect there are many ways to build the architecturesafely robustly reliable reliably and in an understandable way and i think there are almost certainly going to be ways of building architectures that are unsafe or risky in some form so i see as sort of a kind of bottleneck that we have to get humanity through which is building safe architectures as thethe first types of ai systems and then after that we can have a sort of an flourishing of many different types of systems that perhaps sharded of those safe architectures that are ideally have some mathematical guarantees or at least impractical guarantees around what they do to do governments have an essential role here to define what a lielevel playing field looks like and what is absolutely taboo yeah i think it's not just that but actually i think government and civil society and academia and an awful part society have a critical role to play here to shape along with industry labs what that should look like as we get closer to asia and the cooperation needed and the collaboration needed to prevailain't that kind of runaway race dynamic happening okay with a sense that you remain optimistic what's what's this image here it's one of my favorite images actually i call it like the tree of all knowledge so we're talking a lot about science and a lot of science can be boiled down to if you imagine all the knowledge that exists in the world as a tree of macollege and then maybe what we know today as as a civilization is some small subset of that and i see ai as this tool that allows us as scientists to explore potentially the entire tree one day and we have this idea of root no problems that like how for forward the protein folding problem way if you couldcrack them it unlocks an entire new branch of discovery or new research and that's what we try and focus on a deep mind and and google deepmind to crack those and if we get this right then i think we could be you know in this incredible new era of radical abundance curing all diseases spreading consciousness to this daytos and what the single human flourishing what we're out of time but what's what's the last example of light in your dreams that this dream question that you think there is a shot in your lifetime am i might take i mean once a geo has built what i'd like to use it for is to try and use it to understand the fundamental tool nature of riyadhcity so i do experiments at the planck scale you know the the the smallest possible scale theoretical scale which is almost like the resolution of realityyou know i was up religious and in the in the bible there's a story about the tree of knowledge that doesn't work out very wellisis is the is there any scenario where where we discover knowledge that the universe as humans you may not know that potentially i mean there might be some unknowable things so but i think scientific method is the greatest sort of invention humans have ever come upwith the enlightenment and scientific discovery that was built this incredible modern civilization around us and all the tools that we use so i think it's the best technique we have for understanding the enormity of the universe around us will demonstrate you've already changed the world i think probably everyone here will bebe cheering you on in your efforts to ensure that we continue to accelerate in the right direction thank you dennis has all of the
