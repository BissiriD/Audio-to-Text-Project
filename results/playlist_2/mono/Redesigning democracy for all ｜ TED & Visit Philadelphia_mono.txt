the one of the coolest things about walking through the streets of philly and meeting people with different stories is that the united states was built with the stories of people from all over the world and the people that shaped our democracy included indigenous intellectuals black and brown women forcars that were part of the abolitionist movement but when we think about the future of democracy and making it fair and equitable that's not something that most people have experienced and it's an opportunity for us to live into the promise of democracydemocracy needs a redesign and what that presents us is an opportunity to reimagine a democracy that works for everyoneso everybody i want you to close your eyes were saying and i want you to think about your wildest dream for democracy just to have that freedom and that freedom of choice and the freedom to know that i count what i say and what i believe in has purpose and hopefully someone will be there to represent me in what i want and what i feel will begood for allthe power is from the people and for the people i think about people coming together to really advocate for what they want to see if we may have a different opinion we can find a middle ground a world where people are actually able to truly see one another to meet one another and to score one another why not just be the change you know demarchrissy only works if people impacted by decisions are able to participate in the democratic system we have an election that's coming up first student government probably recommendations from my teacherslistening is an essential ingredient in democracy and the reality is when we don't practice listening it limits our ability to incorporate the things that we have heard and learned from others into the path forward that we chartthis is actually a mural on a container that was opened up as a people's budget office so people literally couldn't have posted notes and then the question was like where what needs to be funded and what's important to you as a credible when democracy doesn't include everyone what happens is there are so many peoplewho whose voice whose livelihood is not considered in the laws and policies that we make in the united stateswhen we think about participation it doesn't have to look like what it's looked like before we can design it so that it's fun it meets us where we are it's exciting and it makes senseas people engage in participatory democracy their life changes not only does their perspective of what's possible in democracy change but their likelihood to volunteer in their community chchanges their likelihood to consider running for political office changeson behalf of the united states citizenship and immigration services it is my sincere pleasure to welcome you to this special naturalization ceremony think about democracy as a living breathing thing it's like a tapestry that we're stitching togethercongratulations to each of you with that you are now citizens of the united states of americaand there are parts of it that we can look back to and learn from and there's so much of it that hasn't been stitched yet that hasn't yet been woven i challenge folks to think about what they want to see in democracyand
