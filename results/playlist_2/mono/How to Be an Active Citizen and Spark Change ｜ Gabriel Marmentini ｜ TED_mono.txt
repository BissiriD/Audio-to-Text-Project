theyou can see a brazilian baby cuter and he's just a baby it's a babysitter once we are born voila magically we are already citizens right partially right at least for me yes we do have rights duties we belong to a nation when growowing up we are probably going to pay taxes and travolta and all these are well known characters for good citizens and indeed they are relevant they are true but thinking just this way we are reducing a beautiful concept of citizenship because citizenship is way more than that and i'll explain why soon by the way i am this babyi mean i was and i was smiling this picture because mommy told me that i would be a great citizen one dayand i will do that talk to share my ideasbut unfortunately this is not true my mum never told me that how could she know one prepare her to be a citizen then she wouldn't know what is to be a great one right people in my country are mostly individuals rather than citizens like my mom and myself in the past and that's the point herewe're the unpreparedness for citizenship is the most democratic behavior among us braziliansit doesn't matter where you came from your gender your age your professional background or any other thing the probability that you are a prepare citizen is really lowand for the contest i am thirty years old and our constitution is just thirty five so it's really new right we are still figuring out how to be a democracy you probably already got my point here we are not babysitters no one worn as a citizen we are just individuals and citizenship is something that we mightconquer true life experiences citizenship requires effort we need to acquire knowledge we need to pass through real life experiences where we put our hands on and maybe we can be called a citizen one day and that's my idea worth spreading here the only takeaway i want you to bring back home is the reflectionhow about you being a citizen or just an individual and for those who think that can strengthen your journey to be a better citizen or to start being a citizen i have here the citizen metamorphosis process to share to you is just four ingredients it's really basic stuff you're going to see that there is nothing mind blowing therewhat is mind blowing my ingredients is that we are just not putting them in practice and i dunno why they are simple fun and necessary but before entering the citizen metamorphosis process i need to align with your tree assumptions citizenship for gabriel my conception is about solving public problemsso if you're not going towered solving things that are bothering you in society you're not choosing a problem that resonates with your heart and with your mind and really tried to solve it you are not a citizen for me secondly the state is our hero we rely and we expect a lot of things that someone is going to sayall of our problems especially the stake in some countries and the state of course is important but it's just one actorwe need to unite all sectors to solve public problems together and finally we are a complex society we can see wicked problems everywhere everyday just take a look on the un agenda for twenty thirty maybe we are just copying and pasting the sd gs and trying again because we are failing a lot so we need to solve public problems todaywhether that's about being a citizen so now i have my ingredients here to share to you is just for nothing mind blowing their remember basic stuffing brazil we like to call basic stuff as the rice and beans is a delicious dish that we eat a lot so we need to look forward for the rice and the beans to do something as citizensfirst political knowledge we are raised listening bad things about politics right it's something that is corrupted it's boring it's difficult to understand so we must avoid it that's wrong politics is beautiful and the beauty tool for transformation but we need to understand how to use it and when you dive into this conceptyou need to acquire the basic knowledge to understand your country how your country is organized which institutions are there what they do what are the political parties the ideologies why you're paying taxes where your money is going all these basic answers you must have to be a citizen if you don't have it you need to look forfor it especially in a word of misinformation this gets quite important so political knowledge as the first ingredient is the second one is poor dialogue it's really comfortable to talk about people we love and we agree with and finding divergencies people that will make us feel uncomfortable somehowis just making us grow going outside the bubbles the echo chambers and all this is important and i promise you you're going to learn something new is not about tolerating everything and agreeing with everything people will say but it's about trying to understand how they got to this perspective and what can you learn from them thoroughly we have saved empathy and i bet youbeing listening the word empathy a lot recently but i'm not talking about empathy with human beings that of course is something important but are we exercising empathy we've our neighborhood we've our community we've our city trying to see our city as a human being for a moment and understand those emotions their suffer we need to help itto be better and to indentify our the gaps is our role as citizens and acknowledge that all problems that are surrounding us and that are bothering us we made them somehow we've contributed for the existence of this problems so this is civic empathy and finally community protaganism and i love this becausewhat is the point of having knowledge knowing how to dialogue understanding our city gaps if you're not putting your hands onto something and these beautiful words here tell us two things community first you need to look local and then maybe you can go globalthe big revolution comes from small revolution so look to your community and that's good and protaganism because you have the power you can do whatever you want you just need to move on for it so i've been applying this recipe for a long time into civil society organizations i cofounded in brazil with my team and i can assure you that it's possible to mix up theseingredients and do a good recipe where are you going to take people there is just individuals spectators and bring them to a site where they can find ourselves as change-makers as solvers as citizens and especially we do this better when we design a journey that is simple fun meaningfulintangible creating safe spaces where people really feel that they belong and that we can embrace mistakes as part of the process and hear the kind of things that you can see possible after being traded for citizenship you can teach other people about the political knowledge that you just acquired you can put people to dialogue facilitating conversations areof topics where people are going to broad their tolerance and open their minds you can do awareness campaigns to put emphasis in spreading messages that are relevant for you you can monitor the government and work with it as spears to improve your society you can formulate local diagnosis of public probwants to understand your city gaps and putting practice the civic empathy that i just told you you can use this cd gaps to create public policies from scratch using our methodology for example that is free and available for everybody on line telling people what is the life cycle of a public policy you can take your ideas as pubthe policies and advocate in your municipality doing some kind of lobby to see your ideas coming true and that's precisely the spotlight that i want to put here because we all were taught that the state government has this monopoly of building this public policies and everybody here can be a policy mayacre not just policy takers margaret and victor for example develop a public policy where they created a mobile application to help the elderly to find their rights really easily and also access to basic services in their municipality the proposal was approved by the city council and is just awaitingfor the executive branch to approve the budget they did that from scratch secondly we have hotfile that in the other hand created the skateboarding week besides being an olympic sport now it's really important for kids in brazil to have better opportunities so he presented to the city councillor the approved and is happening his town nowfinally we have photoshop she just presented a public policy to stimulate the cultural tourism in her region putting the original and traditional communities into the center of the process of creating courses and experiences to the tourists the proposal hasn't been approved yet but has been presented the first step has been tosecond we must celebrate itif all these people and baby gabriel now a man became citizens and are involved on solving public problems everyone can be one as well but the reason why i brought my baby image here is not because i find myself beautiful is because we all need to remember that this systemic change will only happen when we start raising our kidsas citizens since the beginning politics democracy and citizenship are not concepts that are out there that we can touch we need to fill them we need to leave them there are set of values that we need to cultivate inside us since the beginning it's a lifetime projectremember citizenship cannot be taken for granted you must deserve it you must conquer it citizenship must be earned to you on the other side thank you so much the
