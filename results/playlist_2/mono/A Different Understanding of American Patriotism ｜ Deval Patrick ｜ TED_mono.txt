thelisten i i'm i'm worried about our democracynowadays we have leaders who who use division itself as a political tool they downplay or or even encourage in some cases a deadly assault to overturn an electionand a bunch of them are working really hard to make it harder to votethe retreat from these processes of democracy no ballot access or legislative debate judicial review they are worrisome enough but what's even more concerning to me is the retreat from the purposes of democracythese old fashioned notions of government of by and for the people the rule of law as superior to the rule of any one personality liberty and justice for allcovert made it harder to overlook deep disparities among us in health and wealth and education and deep unfairness in too much of our policing leaving a lot of americans questioning whether our national commitment to social and economic justice is real for some time nownow in the words of one friend of mine the self evident truth that all people deserve life liberty and the pursuit of happiness seems a long way from settled in the american mindso to me american democracy the suppose id model of the form is up for grabsi'm worried not just as a lawyer or a former public official but also and mainly as a patrioti grew up on the south side of chicago in a crowded two bedroom tenement with my mother my sister my grandparents and various relatives who came and went i went to big overcrowded under-resourced sometimes violent public schools and yet my grandmother would neveror permit us to say we were poor just broke she'd say because broke is temporary and think about it here is this refugee from the jim crow southwho still believed in an america where with hard work preparation and faith both religious and civic you could lift yourself from your circumstances of birthi am for her the result and the symbol of her faith in america so you better believe i'm a patriotbut patriotism for black americans is trickyit's tricky to love a country that doesn't always love you backi think of the black man who set off to fight for freedom in the world wars and then came home to be denied those very freedoms some of them lynched while wearing their military uniformsi think of the the black laborers who built great public universities whose doors were closed to them the black voters who elected great public leaders whose policies like the g i bill were closed to them for are a lot of our history american democracy itselfshe has been closed to black people lots of grandmothers like mine have grandsons and granddaughters who never had their chance still doi remember in college a white classmate asked me why on earth would you want to be blackwhen i told her i hadn't considered the alternativeand never would she seemed startled and confused i attribute this in part to the fact that i've spoke and dressed like a preppy i get that part but mostly i think she was confused because she couldn't imagine why any black person in his or her right mind wouldn't trade places with heri think it would blow her mind as it may some of yours when i say i am also proud to be a patriot given our history being black and patriotic will certainly strike some people as strange if not absurdi dunno when patriotism turned into you know lapel pins and flyovers and silly arguments about pro football players taking a kneemy love of country is about national aspirationamerica is the only nation in human history organized not by geography or a common culture or language or religion or even race but by a handful of civic ideals and we've come to define those ideals over time and through struggle as equality opportuneunity and fair play why because that's what makes freedom possiblethat's the america my grandmother believed in that's the america that has made us a magnet to talent from all over the world that's the america that makes me and countless other men and women from every race and background a patriotin a way the founders for all their flaws designed america to be a nation of values is sort of a country with a conscience and we've struggled with and against that country's conscience from the startbut true patriots understand given that context that america cannot be great without also being goodso when we cage refugee children to discourage their parents from seeking sanctuary here true patriots know we cannot be great without being good when bullets fly in houses of worship or in schools or in nightclubs or in grocery stores and our leaders choose the slogans of thegun lobby over the lives of innocents patriots no we cannot be great without being goodwhen unarmed black and brown citizens are shot down by unaccountable police when our justice system is not yet consistently just patriots know we cannot be great without being goodwhen the economy moves on and leaves broken lives and broken expectations behind it and our leaders just shrug or when the public schools continue to fail poor children and when we can always find the money for a weapons system the military doesn't want but not the money for the healthcarea young family or senior needs patriots know or must ask themselves can we be great without being goodand when we choose a power grab over a fair voteevery true patriot knows we cannot be greatwithout being goodpatriotism demands more than ceremony and sanctimony it's about more than what you say you believe it's about living the values of equality opportunity and fair play even when it's inconvenient even when it gets in the way of partisan advantage ieeven when it compels us to be mindful of and compassionate towards the lowly the vulnerable the different and the despised because that's what american democracy is forof course we have policies to fix whether in job growth or education in immigration or the justice system or in these processes of democracy itself but before we can fix our policies we have to fix our politics and by that i am not just talking about better tone or hyper partisanship or a willingnice to compromise as important as all of that is i'm talking about our purpose sure we should debate and we always do what role government should play in any of this in meeting our civic obligations but let's try for once not to forget in the heat of the debate that social and echoingcomic justice was the point from the startbut i think saving our democracy will take more not just from elected officials or civic leaders or the media but more from each one of us and we're going to have to start i think by putting our cynicism downi'm going to give you an example of what i meannear the end of my time in office america faced a crisis not unlike today's when there wereall these unaccompanied children some as young as three and four years old who were flooding across the southern border having fled over thousands of miles from violence in central america and then just like now the federal authorities were overwhelmedso president obama who was in office at the time called on a number of states to temporarily shelter and care for some of these children while they were being processed under our lawsfeelings around immigration ran hot then just like noweven so i agree that our commonwealth would help because sheltering poor children fleeing unspeakable violence was to me an act of patriotismit has given sanctuary to desperate children for more than a century we rescued irish children from famine russian and ukrainian children from religious persecution cambodian children from genocide haitian children from earthquakes sudanese children from civil war our own new orleans children from hurricane katrina wowonce in nineteen thirty nine we turned our backs on jewish children fleeing the nazis and it remains a blight on our national reputation as i fear the separation of children in the last administration will be remembered the point is that our esteem and our power is enhanced when we restq the desperate and diminished when we don't still i'm not naive i knew my decision would be controversial and indeed for that decision i was called on hate radio and in social media everything but a child of goda couple of days after i announced my decision on an unusually quiet saturday morning my wife diane gave me a list of stuff to go get it at the home depot proving for some of you who know her that there is no office high enough that excuses you from one of her honey do listsit was a it was early in the day and i thought i'd just slip out quickly with you know on my own without bothering my security detail what harm could come of thati knew exactly where i was going and where to find everything on my list so i set off in the truck in a t-shirt and jeans and flip flops dark glasses and a baseball cap and it didn't matter i was outed by the manager in the very first iowa good morning governor welcome to the home depot how can i help youi encountered a man in the checkout line who was red hot madnot not hostile or threatening just really angry and loud and he let me have it governor said i couldn't disagree with you more about your decision he said my own wife is an immigrant she came here illegally that's the way it ought to be and i just want you to know i think you're wrongnow in that circumstance there was no point in trying to engage with him about how being a refugee is legal under american law i just thanked him for his feedback but everybody in the checkout line and in that area of the story knew who was mad at whom and what he was mad aboutnow i had six other encounters in the store on the same subjectand in every one of those someone came up and whispered governor you're doing the right thinggovernor thanks for looking out for those kids governor i'm with youthe calls to the office were two and three to one in favor of sheltering those childrenand when i reflect on that i think to myself when did we learnto shout our anger and a whisper our kindness is completely upside downi dunno if that's the reality tv culture we live in or what but it's totally backwards is time we learned again to shout kindness to shout compassion to shout justice that's the purpose of american democracy and the sourceone of our greatnessblessedly we're starting to see more and more expressions of this kind of thing across this country more and more people coming off the sidelines overcoming their cynicism and fatalism and standing up for america at her generous and optimistic best from women who are demandsto be treated with respect and decency everyone deserves from survivors of domestic violence and abuse demanding to be seen and heard and believed from black and brown people who are demanding consistent professionalism and the presumption of innocence from police from studernz who are demanding we choose their lives and safety over the proliferation of military weapons in civilian hands from all those lawyers who showed up at polling places in twenty twenty or at airports after the so-called muslim ban demanding respect for the rule of lawlaw black lives matter time's up black girl magic occupy wall street families belong togetherat any given time on any given issue they may make any one of us uncomfortablebut they have taken to the legislatures to the ballot boxes to the court rooms and peacefully to the streets to lay claim to their democracy its purpose as well as it's processes and ultimately to affirm the american conscience they are shouting kindnessif american style democracy is to have a chance more of us had better put our own cynicism down summon up our own patriotismand join them thank you very muchi
