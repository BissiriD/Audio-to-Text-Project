the in ukrainian the word for a vote is the same as that for a voice homeless so to cast your vote for someone is to literally give them your voice and it makes sense by choosing our political representatives will then themour voice if they misuse it it can render us voiceless but if they use it well it can amplify our voice making sure that it is hard amplifying the voices of the silenced is at the heart of democracynow you might wonder why on earth this ukrainian thinks that she can talk about democracy as a historian surely i should know that my country has been locked in an empire of one sort or another until recently and there's been struggling with corruption and other challenges since it regained independenceand you'll be right to wonder that but i would like to suggest that those are the reasons that qualify me to talk about democracyin spite of numerous obstacles throughout their history ukrainians continued to walk the road to democracy in spite of numerous attempts by our rulers from the russian side to communist dictators to silence us we found ways of making our voices heardand i'd like to focus on three lessons that we could learn from ukrainians that can help us strengthen our voices wherever we are in the world perseverance unity and divisionlet me start with perseverancestates that haven't enjoyed a long history of self ruled dawn tend to be taken seriously in discussions that are dominated by nations with a long democratic traditionwhat could the young state possibly contribute to a conversation about democracy it's only just learning how to be democraticwhen i experienced the sort of dismissal over ukrainian voice in some international discussions it reminded me of a situation when a young woman's experience is dismissed by a group of older menscum possibly have anything of value to contribute to a serious conversation can see naturally i like to challenge that viewukraine's history of statelessness demonstrates that living under oppressive regimes ukrainians learned the value of freedom for us is not something to be taken for granted it's something to be fought for and once gained protectedanother legacy of statelessness is the fact that we don't have a tradition of revering rulers in fact we are pretty suspicious of political leaders those who have tried to hold onto power and flirted with authoritarianism got a taste of democracy inaction democrat tia after all means people powerukrainians take to the streets at least once a decade to protect their freedom many of you might remember the last major protests that took place in ukraine in twenty thirteen twenty fourteen they came to be known as the revolution of dignitypeaceful protesters came out to the squares all over ukraine to demonstrate against corruption and abuse of power by the president of the time one of the iconic figures for those protesters was that as shevchenko and nineteenth century ukrainian poet who is known as the founder of the ukrainian nationthe poems that he wrote in the subjugated stateless ukraine of the nineteenth century fueled protesters in twenty first century ukraine as they fought to consolidate democracy one of the first protesters killed by the riot police was said he knew i am the last footage of said he from the protesters of heri'm reciting shift juncos poem and the most famous line is buried this purported to keep fighting and you will prevailin other words perseverethe revolution of dignity ended in the victory of the people the corrupt president fled the country and the nation was able to choose a new leadership in the free and fair election the country was en route to consolidating his democratic institutions but threatened by people poweron his doorstep the kremlin started a war against ukraine in two thousand and fourteena flourishing democracy next door is a scary thing for an autocrat so ukrainians continue to persevere to protect their freedom but now we also have to do so on the battlefield let me now turn to unitythe protesters said he knew a yan was armenian by ethnicity his participation in the ukrainian nationhood was a political choice a multiethnic multicultural multilingual nation ukraine has been deliberately presented by the kremlin and misunderstood by much of the world as dividedin reality diversity makes this political nation only more united in times of crisis for instance crimean tatars know very well what it means to suffer from colonization and repression they were deported from crimea their homeland in nineteen forty four by stalin and have been persecuted by the russian occupying natocharities since twenty fourteenthat is why you will find them fighting in the ukrainian armed forces for the liberation of all parts of ukraine alongside ukrainians of polish jewish romanian or any other backgrounds protecting the rights of one group supports the protection of all ukrainians have an official day of unipity it is celebrated on the twenty second of january the date is chosen because on the twenty second of january nineteen nineteen ukrainian lands that had previously been ruled by the habsburgs and the romanovs united into one state through the treaty of unity that state doesn't last long butthe experience of unity and sovereignty left a powerful legacy that is why on the twenty second of january twenty twenty two just the months before the start of the full scale invasion when the russian troops while all around the ukrainian borders ready to attack citizens of ukraine indifferentparts of the country formed a human chain in celebration of the past and in defense of the future and this brings me to vision the vision of ukraine as a democratic united country free of imperial oppression has it's roots in the time when independence and democracy couldsuddenly be a dreambut it is people that make dreams come truei know it i watched one such dream become a reality it was on the first of december nineteen ninety one i was seven at the time he was the first taste of democracy for me but also for my country i was born when ukraine was still part of the u s s r i caught the tail end of the coupcrumbling soviet empire that held regular but utterly pointless elections elections with only one winning candidate i witness the implementation of a social contract that said will pretend to give you a vote and you'll pretend to electorson the first of december nineteen ninety one everything was different no more pretending this was for realthe nation was being asked to determine it's future in a referendum there was only one question to answer do you support the act of declaration of independence of ukrainethe turnout was eighty four percentalmost thirty million people over ninety percent of those who voted said yes the u s assad was dissolved a week later now if that is not people power i don't know what isthe experience of witnessing this referendum had a profound effect on me i remember my entire family wrestling in our finest traditional embroidered shirts vicia of anarchy to go to the polling station he felt like a holiday and perhaps it was gaining freedom is definitely something worth celebrating generations of youiranians before nineteen ninety one had a vision of the future for their country but their voices were silencedmy parents' generation managed to get their voices heard and willed that vision into being it is up to my generation and those who come after to protect that vision of a democratic ukraineso the three lessons from ukraine the simple and we can turn to them whatever we are facing the fight for democracyhave a vision of the future that is worth fighting forthe united in that fightand all you'll need to succeed will be perseveranceand if there's one thing ukrainians do know about democracy is that it's really hard workbut it pays offthat are shevchenko the nineteenth century poet i cited the stat of my dog was born into serfdom he had no power no political voice eventually he was bought out of serfdom but his freedom continued to be limited as soon as his fiery poetry criticizing russian imperial oppression was discovered he was imprisonedsent to serve in the imperial army for ten years as a private and banned from writing so he was robbed of his voice for a second timeand yet his poetic voice was so powerful that the verses he wrote not only survived the repression of his times but also fueled and sustained the future generations who fought for and achieved independence in september twenty twenty two when the soldiers of the ukrainian armed forces will liberthe city of biloxi a in the kharkiv region they tore down a billboard poster poster depicting the russian flag and the slogan which said we are one nation with russia it had been put there by the occupying russian authoritiesand nice that poster was another predating the occupation it was a portrait of thrash of cinco and the famous lines from his poemworried this or bought it therekeep fighting and you will prevailthank youthree
