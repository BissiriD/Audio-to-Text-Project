thewhen the flint water crisis happened in michigan i was already feeling pretty disillusioned with the state of the world i was twenty seven i had an hour long commute to work i worked in the recycling industry which i liked but i spent most of my day crawling around in garbage cans and i would listen to the radio on my hour longcommute and hear about how there are all of these bills that the people of michigan wanted to see passed yet our legislature wasn't doing anything about it and i found out that the reason they weren't was because of a thing called gerrymandering which basically meant that when voting districts were being drawn our politicians would pick and choose which votehers they wanted voting for them to all have a guarantee that they were going to win the election or that their political party was going to win an election i kept thinking like how is this the world we live in kids don't have clean water politicians are doing anything and aren't afraid of our vote like doesn't anybody care ofand and why doesn't somebody do something about thisand i didn't realize that soon by accident i would figure out that actually a lot of people do care and that next morning before going to work just kind of out of frustration i made a post on facebook and it said hey i want to take on gerrymandering in michigan if you want to help let me know smilingface and the he was very key and i didn't think that this would actually do much of anything i thought maybe i had a couple of other friends who thought this was a big deal maybe we'd volunteer somewhere i certainly didn't think that it would lead to a political movement of over ten thousand people that it would lead to amending our state constitutionor actually a restoring faith in democracy in our state in general but when i went to work and then at lunchtime check social media i started to see that people were responding and they were saying things like i've cared about this issue for such a long time i'm so glad you're doing something about it please let me know how i can help katie let's dothis big and that's when it struck me like oh noand these people think i know what i'm doing and i did notso i quickly googled how do you and gerrymanderingit turns out that it's all related to a process called the redistricting process and if you wanted to end gerrymandering you had to get the politicians to stop being the ones getting to pick and choose who their voters were and that made a lot of sense because when politicians would draw these lines instead of keeping communities togetherwe would get districts that look like this in no way does that represent an actual group of peopleand why this is particularly important in michigan is where a pretty purple state and what i mean by that is that about half of us vote for democrats and about half of us vote for republicans and that should mean that about half of our representatives should be democrats and about half of them should be republicans but depending on which political party would be in charge of thethe redistricting process they would actually have a majority of the elected representatives or sometimes even a super majority even though they might have received less than half of the votes or exactly half and that would then mean that they don't even have to talk to anybody on the other side of the aisle when passing any kind of laws and the other important part is that redis areacting only happens once every ten years so you have half of the state being locked entirely out of the decision making process for ten years at a time it did not seem like a good way to be doing democracy so we went to the politicians who were like you guys should change that and they were like nothe moviethey were not interested in giving themselves less power but thankfully we figured out that in michigan we had a form of direct democracy and it was called the ballot initiative process and so i turned to my coworker kelly we're at the recycling job and we started getting to work to figure out okay what is this ballot initiative process what what can this appactually do and we broke it down into three different steps one we had to write constitutional language didn't know how to do that too we had to gather a lot of signatures and we didn't know how to do that either three we had to get about half of our state to vote yes on wanting to amend the constitution to enjoymeandering and guess what we didn't know how to do that either but we had this facebook post that then we turned into a facebook group and we started seeing all these people coming in who were absolutely amazing a lot of them were just like me they voted consistently they cared about the world's problems but they weren't really interested in volunteering for a politlocal campaign or one party or the other but these people are amazing i mean we had veterinarians doctors birthing doulas we had butchers and veterans and even sixteen year old kids who couldn't vote yet but wanted to be a part of creating a change so that by the time they could vote it would actually be legit so what we started to do was figureyou're out okay what are all these campaign tasks and then what are all these skills we have and how do we start bringing them together for example we had a woman who had been in charge of the renaissance festival for years and michigan and she actually started creating our first fundraising plan and the reason she did that is because she had experience raising money for kind of weird stufffand we had another woman who is absolutely amazing her name was jamie she was an engineer and a retired high school math teacher and she was basically the only person who had actually volunteered for a political campaign before so she had gathered signatures she had knocked on doors and using her skills in engineering and math shefigure it out how could we take thousands of us to actually end up reaching millions of voters and that all is really exciting and then i had a volunteer rebecca and she came up to me and she's like i really want to volunteer i have time to do it but i just don't think there's any way i can contribute i was like alright well what do you do when she said i'm a stay at home mom and i said first of all that cawith a lot of skills so we've got a lot to work with but what are your hobbies she said well i'm a jazzercise instructor and a woodcarver great great we are going to find a place so we started thinking how could we apply these skills it turns out an order together a bunch of signatures you actually need a bunch of clipboardsand buying clipboards even in bulk is super expensive and we started from facebook boat so we did not have a lot of money and when we went to our facebook group and we said hey can you guys help us figure out what we might be able to do it turns out we not only had one but several woodcarvers and the woodcarvers said hold on give us a second they went away they made a plan and cameback and they had decided to create gift registries at home depots and lows across the state reserving wood so we could cut our own clipboards then they found warehouses where we could then cut those clipboards and start assembling them then they were thinking a lot about these clipboards so they started to think about like how do we make them longer so theycan hold both a petition as well as gathering contact information from people and then they wanted all of us to be able to be recognized as volunteers so they added a nice little red stripe so that people could know that were part of the ending gerrymandering campaign and they even thought about how could we turn this clipboard itself if we're going to make such an investment inthem into an actual tool to educate people on the process in general they ended up being able to make these clipboards for only thirty three cents each instead of eleven dollars yes hey and the only reason we were able to do any of that so that everybody could have a professional tool that made them feel confident when talking to strrangers about civics was because we had a woodcarver as a volunteer and that was one of the first moments when i started to realize that like us not doing politics as our day job was actually our strength we were looking at democracy as how we hoped it would be instead of the brokenness that it alreadyhe was and so when we were looking at writing the constitutional language we wanted to take that spirit and apply it at the time and michigan politicians were refusing to hold town halls they didn't want to meet with their constituents because they were getting a lot of criticism because they were writing laws that nobody wanted and so at a time when we weren't being listened to we thoughtokay let's go listen to each other instead so we made a plan to go and ask people what would they want in a redistricting process what would one that works well and that we could have trust in actually look like we set a goal of going to every congressional district and we weren't sure if people are going to show up because we are brand new organizations just starting but to our surprise it wasstanding room only at almost every single location and we would hear all of these people saying you know i have lived in this community my whole life and a politician has never even visited our city once and yet here you are a random stranger from across the state not only listening to me but making sure that my opinions going to be used in a constantsituational amendment and what my favorite part was is you would have people coming in really skeptical of each other never having really had a conversation with a democrat or a republican or an independent and they would kind of start to talk to each other and realize that we had a lot more in common and all of us just wanted a political process that worked and so endsset of focusing on those differences we were able to focus on actual solutions so once our beautiful language written by the people of michigan was ready to go we then got together those three hundred and fifteen thousand six hundred and fifty four registered michigan voter signatures in one hundred and eighty days but thankfully we had that math teachernoas we figured out that if we could get about one thousand of us to gather about seventeen signatures a day we'd be able to meet this goal but because we had gone around the state and we had listened to people about what they wanted they all wanted to make sure that this constitutional amendment passed we ended up having overfour thousand people who are willing to come and gather signatures and they had tons of creativity about how to talk to people about gerrymandering and they were willing to do anything to gather those signatures they went into parades and even literal cow pastures in order to make sure that we were getting the people of michigan to sign and we ended up blowingthat goal out of the water we were able to gather over four hundred and forty two thousand signaturesthen only one hundred and ten days may i add and although there is no geographic requirement of where those signatures came from we actually gathered signatures in each of michigan's eighty three counties truly making it for by and of the people of michigan so then wehe just needed people to vote on the darn thing and i november six of twenty eighteen two point five million people sixty one percent of the state overwhelmingly voted yes to end gerrymandering and to instate an independent citizens redistricting commissionthen shortly after that we got to see did this constitutional law written by a bunch of strangers actually work and so our commission started to come together thirteen strangers were selectedfour democrats four republicans and five independent voters they couldn't be politicians they couldn't be lobbyists they just had to be regular people those people were then invited to represent the state so there was a lottery to make sure that the demographics actually kind of matched who the people of michigan were making it one of the oneonly decision making bodies in michigan that actually looks like the people of michigan they then had the task of going around the state and gathering input from people asking them what they wanted to see in the redistricting process and they held town halls that also had standing room only even though it was only very shortly after coven this commission ended up herepassing maps that are the most fair maps that michigan has ever had in the first election they were used in twenty twenty two how people voted was an exact match for how elected representatives were elected this is my personal district in the before and after picture and at my favorite part about all of this is that because weactually changed the constitution it means that in future redistricting processes this is going to have to be the same process that's used which means that future voters will be guaranteed to have fair elections from here on out i'm sure that each of you guys have something that keeps you up at night that makes you feel like man i really wish somebody would do something aboutthis and maybe you feel like you aren't qualified to be the one to do something or maybe you feel like nobody is listening or cares about this issue and i used to feel that way and one thing that i did not remember but ended up popping up on my social media is i made almost the exact same facebook post about a year earlier and it said like heyhey let's end gerrymandering who wants to help and nobody even liked itand more importantly i also didn't do anything about it and i think that's because i felt alone i felt like man nobody's even liking this like i must be the only weirdo who wants to end gerrymandering but by the time i made that second facebook post what i realized was that actually like a lot of uswe're feeling the exact same way we were sitting feeling like nobody cared we really wanted this issue to be dealt with but we felt like there must be somebody else whose job it is there must be an expert out there but what i have completely learned is that you do not have to be an expert to get involved in democracy you don't need a fancy title or a phd you don't even have to askask permission to try you never know where one little step will end up leading you it might change your entire life and i think that's really important to remember i mean there's a place for experts to i definitely should not perform open heart surgery on any of you i would not be good at it but we are the ones who are closest to these problemsour community is and our kids are the ones who do not have clean drinking water we have the most incentive to want to fix these problems because we live with its brokenness every single day and we see our communities as actual communities they are our homes they aren't red are blue they are just us so i hope all of europemember that when it comes to democracy all political power is inherent in the people we all are those people and this is our power i hope you don't forget that and you remain unafraid to create the world you want to live in thank youthree
