the theatre matters because democracy matters theatre is the essentialart form of democracy and we know this because they were born in the same city in the late sixth century bc the idea of western democracy was born it was of course a very partial and flawed democracy but the idea that power should stem from the consent of the governed that power should flowlow from below to above not the other way round was born in that decade and in that same decade somebody legend has it somebody named festus invented the idea of dialogue what does that mean to invent dialogue while we know that the festival of dionysus gathered the entire citizenry of athens on the side of the cropplus and they would listen to music they would watch dancing and they would have stories told as part of the festival of dionysius and storytelling as much like what's happening right now i'm standing up here the unitary authority and i am talking to you and you are sitting back and you're receiving what i have to say and you madedisagree with it you may think i'm an insufferable fool you may be bored to death but that dialogue is mostly taking place inside your own headbut what happens if instead of me talking to you and thought of this i just shift ninety degrees to the left and i talked to another person on stage with meeverything changes because at that moment i'm not the possessor of truth i'm a guy with an opinion and i'm talking to somebody else and you know what that other person has an opinion too and it's drama remember conflict they disagree with me there's a conflict between the twotwo points of view and the the thesis of that is that the truth can only emerge in the conflict of different points of view it's not the possession of any one person and if you believe in democracy you have to believe that if you don't believe that you're an autocrat whose putting up withdemocracy but that's the basic thesis of democracy that the conflict of different points of views leads to the truth what's the other thing that's happening i'm not asking you to sit back and listen to me and ask you to lean forward and imagine my point of view what this looks like and feels like to me as a carerrichter and then i'm asking you to switch your mind and imagine what it feels like to the other person talking i'm asking you to exercise empathy and the idea of the truth comes from the collision of different ideas and the emotional muscle of empathy are the necessary tools for deathdemocratic citizenship what else happens and the third thing really is you is the community itself is the audience and you know from personal experience that when you go to the movies you walk into a movie theater and if it's empty you're delighted because nothing's going to be between you and the movie you can spread out putyour legs over the top of the stadium seats each popcorn and just enjoy it but if you walk into a live theatre and you see that the theaters have full your heart sinks you're disappointed immediately because whether you knew it or not you were coming to that theater to be part of an audience you were coming to have the collectori have experience of laughing together crying holding your breath together to see what's going to happen next you may have walked into that theater as an individual consumer but if the theater does it's job you've walked out with a sense of yourself as part of a whole as part of the communitythat's built into the dna of my art formtwenty five hundred years later joe papp decided that culture should belong to everybody in the united states of america and that it was his job to try to deliver on that promise he created free shakespeare in the park and free shakespeare in the park is based on a very simple idea the idea that the besttheater the best art that we can produce should go to everybody and belong to everybody and to this day every summer night in central park two thousand people are lining up to see the best theatre we can provide for free it's not a commercial transactionin nineteen sixty seven thirteen years after he figured that out he figured out something else which is that the democratic circle was not complete by just giving the people the classics we had to actually let the people create their own classics and take the stage and so in nineteen sixty sevenjoe opened the public theater downtown on astor place and the first show he ever produced was the world premiere of hair as the first thing he ever did wasn't shakespeare clive barnes and the times said that resist mr papp took a broom and swept up all the refugees from the east village street onto the stage at at the pub hedidn't mean it compliment really but joe put it up in the lobby he was so proud of itand what the public theater did over the next years with amazing shows like for colored girls who have considered suicide when the rainbow is enoughthe a chorus line and perhaps even hears the most extraordinary example i can think of larry kramer's savage cry of rage about the aids crisis the normal heart because when joe produced that play in nineteen eighty five there was more information about aidsin frank rich's review in the new york times then the new york times published in the previous four years larry was actually changing the dialogue about age through writing this play and joe was by producing and i was blessed to commission and work on tony kushner's angels in america and when doing that playoh and along with normal heart we could see that the culture was actually shifting and it wasn't caused by the theatre but the theater was doing it's part to change what it meant to be gay in the united states and i'm incredibly proud of thatthen i took over joe's old job at the public in two thousand and five i realized one of the problems we had was a victim of our own success which is shakespeare in the park had been founded as a program for access and it was now the hardest ticket to get in new york city people slept out forfor two nights to get those tickets what was that doing that was eliminating ninety eight percent of the population from even considering going to it so we refounded the mobile unit and took shakespeare to prisons to homeless shelters to community centers in all five boroughs and even in new jersey and westchester county and that programram proved something to us that we knew intuitively people's need for theatre is as powerful as their desire for food or for drink it's been an extraordinary success and we've continued it and then there was yet another barrier that we realized we weren't crossing which is a barrier of participation and the idea we said is how can wewe turned theatre from being a commodity an object back into what it really is a set of relationships among people and under the guidance of the amazing leer the best and a we started the public works program which now every summer produces these immense shakespearean musical pageants where tony award winning actorsthe musicians are side by side with nannies and domestic workers and military veterans and recently incarcerated prisoners amateurs and professionals performing together on the same stage and it's not just a great social program it's the best art that we do and the thesis of it is that artistry isnot something that is the possession of a few artistry is inherent in being a human being some of us just get to spend a lot more of our lives practicing itand then occasionally you get a miracle like hamilton lin-manuel extraordinary retelling of the foundational story of this country through the eyes of the only founding father who was a bastard immigrant orphan from the west indies and what lin was doing his examexactly what shakespeare was doing he was taking the voice of the people the language of the people elevating it into verse and by doing so ennobling the language and ennobling the people who spoke the language and by casting that show entirely with a cast of black and brown peoplewhat lynn was saying to us he was reviving in us our greatest aspirations for the united states our better angels of america our sense of what this country could be the inclusion that was at the heart of the american dream and it unleashed a wave ofpatriotism in me and in our audience the appetite for which is proving to be insatiablebut there was another side to that is where i want to end and the last year i want to talk about some of you may have heard that vice president mike pence came to see hamilton in new york and when he came in some of my fellow new yorkers booed him and beautifully he said that's what freedom sounds likeand at the end of the show we read what i feel was a very respectful statement from the stage and vice president elect pence listened to it but it sparked a certain amount of outrage a tweet storm and also an internet boycott of hamilton from outraged people who thought we had treated him with disrespecti looked at that boycott and i said we're getting something wrong here all of these people who have signed this boycott petition they were never going to see hamilton anywayit was never going to come to a city near them if it could come they couldn't afford a ticket and if they could afford a ticket they didn't have the connections to get that ticket they weren't boycotting us we had boycotted themand if you look at the red and blue electoral map of the united states and if i were to tell you oh the blue is what designates all of the major nonprofit cultural institutions i'd be telling you the truth you'd believe me we in the culture have done exactly what the economy what the educational system weretechnology has done which is turn our back on a large part of the country so this idea of inclusion it has to keep going next fall we are sending out on tour a production of lynn nottage is brilliant pulitzer prize winning play sweat years of research and reading pennsylvania lawher to write this play about the deindustrialization of pennsylvania what happened when steel left the rage that was unleashed the tensions that run loose the racism that was unleashed by the loss of jobs were taking that play and were touring it to rural countiesin pennsylvania ohio michigan minnesota and wisconsin we're partnering with community organizations there to try and make sure not only that we reach the people that we're trying to reach but that we find ways to listen to them back and say the culture is here for youyou too because the we in the culture industry we in the theater have no right to say that we don't know what our job is it's in the dna of our art form our job is to hold up as tour a mirror to nature to showoh scorn her image to show virtue her appearance and the very age it's form and pressure our job is to try to hold up a vision to america that shows not only who all of us are individually but that welds us back into the commonality thatwe need to be the sense of unity the sense of whole the sense of who we are as a country that's what the theater is supposed to do and that's what we need to try to do as well as we can thank you very muchthree
