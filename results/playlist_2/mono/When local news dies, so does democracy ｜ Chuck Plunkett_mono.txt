the i've been a journalist for more than twenty three years at the arkansas democrat gazette the pittsburgh tribune review and most rerecently the denver postwhen i started at the denver post in two thousand and three it was among the country's ten largest newspapers with an impressive subscriber base in nearly three hundred journalistsat the time i was in my thirties any ambitious journalist that age aspires to work for one of the big national papers like the new york times or the wall street journal but i was simply blown away by my first few weeks at the denver post and i thought this is going to be my paper i can make a career right herewhile seven years passed we were sold to a hedge fund alden global capitalwithin a few yearsas some of you know this storyiwithin a few years buyouts ordered by past and present owners would reduce the newsroom by nearly halfand i understood the rule of thumb used to be that eighty percent of a newspaper's revenue came from pricey print ads and classifieds with emerging giants like google and facebook and craigslist those advertising dollars were evaporating the entire industry was undergoing a massive shift from printthe digital orleans orders were to be digital first take advantage of blogs video and social media they said that one day the money we made online would make up for the money we lost in printbut that day never camein two thousand and thirteen we won a pulitzer prize for covering the aurora theater shooting alden ordered that more journalists be cutagain and again and again and again we were forced to say goodbye to talented hardworking journalists we considered not just friends but familythose of us left behind were stretched impossibly thin covering multiple beats and writing rushed articlesinside a windowless meeting room in march of two thousand and eighteen we learned that thirty more would have to gothis paper that once had three hundred journalists would now have seventyand it didn't make sense here we'd won multiple pulitzer prizes we shifted our focus from print to digital we hit ambitious targets an email from the brass talked up the posts profit margins which industry experts pegged at nearly twenty per centso if our company was so successful and so profitable why was our newsroom getting so much smaller and smalleri knew that what was happening in colorado was happening around the country since two thousand and four nearly eighteen hundred news rooms have closedyou've heard of food deserts these are news deserts they are communities often entire counties with little to zero news coverage whatsoever making matters worse many papers have become ghost ships pretending to sail with a newsroom but really just wrapping adsaround filler copymore and more newsrooms are being sold off to companies like harding and in that meeting their intentions couldn't have been clearer harvest which you can throw away what's left so working in secret with a team of eight writers we prepareshare the special sunday perspective section on the importance of local newsthat denver rebellion launched like a missile and went off like a hydrogen bombthe clearly we weren't alone in our outrage but as expected i was forced to resignand a year later nothing's changed the denver post is but a few lone journalist doing their admirable best in this husk of a once great papernow at least some of you are thinking to yourself so what right so why let this dying industry die and i kind of get that for one thing the local news has been in decline for so long that many of you may not even remember what it's like tohave a great local paper maybe you've seen spotlight or the paper movies that romanticize what journalism used to be well i'm not here to be romantic or nostalgic i'm here to warn you that when local news dies so does our democracy andthat should concern you regardless of whether you subscribe here's why a democracy is a government of the people people are the oneultimate source of power and authority a great local news room acts like a mirror it's journalist see the community and reflect it back that information is empowering seen knowing understanding this is how good decisions are made when you have a great local paypaper you have journalists sitting in on every city council meeting listening in to state house and senate hearings those important but let's face it sometimes devastatingly boring committee hearings journalists discover the flaws and ill conceived measures and those bills fail because thepublic was well informed readers go to the polls and they know the pros and cons behind every ballot measure because journalist did the heavy lifting for them even better researchers have found that reading a local paper can mobilize thirteen percent of non voters to votethirteen percent the number that can change the outcome of many elections when you don't have a great local paper voters are left stranded at the polls confused trying to make their best guess based on a paragraphof legal ease flawed measures pass well conceived but highly technical measures fail voters become more partisanrecently in colorado our governor's race had more candidates than anyone can remember in years past journalist would have thoroughly vetted scrutinized fact checked profile debated every contender in the local paperthe denver post did it's best but in the place of past levels of rigorous reporting and research the public is increasingly left to interpret dog and pony show stump speeches and clever campaign ads for themselveswith advertising costing what it does electability comes down to money so by the end of the prime areas the only candidates less dandy were the wealthiest and best funded many experienced and praiseworthy candidates never got oxygen because when local news declines heeven big ticket races become pay to playis it any surprise that our new governor was the candidate worth more than three hundred million dollars or the billionaire businessman like donald trump and howard schultz can seize the political stage i don't think this is what the founding fathers had in mind when they talked about thethough now this is exactly why we can't just rely on the big national papers like the journal and the times and the post those are tremendous papers and we need them now my godmore than ever before but there is no world in which they could cover every election in every county in the country know the newsroom best equipped to cover your local election ought to be your local newsroom if you're lucky and still have onewhen election day is over a great local paper is still there waiting like a watchdog when they're being watched politicians have less power police do right by the public even massive corporations are on their best behavior this mechanism that for generatescience has helped inform and guide us no longer functions the way it used to you know intimately what the poison national discourse feels like what our mockery of reason debate it has become this is what happens when local newsrooms shudder and communities across the countrywatched in one c until we recognize that the decline of local news has serious consequences for our society this situation will not improve a properly staffed local newsroom isn't profitable and in this age of google and facebook it's not going to beif newspapers are vital to our democracy then we should fund them like they're vital to our democracythough we cannot stand by and let our watchdogs be put down we can't let more communities vanish into darkness it is time to debate a public funding option before the fourth estate disappears and with it our grand demsocratic experiment we need much more than a rebellion it is time for a revolution thank you the
