the is it just me or are there other people here that are a little bit disappointed with democracythough so let's look at a few numbersif we look across the world the median turnout in presidential elections over the last thirty years has been just sixty seven percentnow we go to europe and we look at people that participated in eu parliamentary elections then we didn't turn out in those elections is just forty two percentnow let's go to new york and let's see how many people voted in the last election for mayor and we would find that only twenty four percent of people showed up to vote what that means is that if friends were still running joey and maybe phoebe who had shown up to voteand you cannot blame them because people are tired of politicians and people are tired of other people using the data that they have generated to communicate with their friends and family to target political propaganda add them but the thing about this is that this is not new nowadays people use likes to target propaganda at youbefore they use your zip code or your gender or your age because the idea of targeting people with propaganda for political purpose is as old as politics and the reason why that idea is there is because democracy has a basic vulnerability this is the idea of a representative in principle democracy is the ability ofpeople took third power but in practice we have to delegate that power to a representative that can exert that power for us that representative is a bottleneck or a weak spot it is the place that you want to target if you want to attack democracy because you can capture democracy by either capturing that representative or capturing the way that peopleitso the big question is is this the end of historyis this the best that we can do or actually are there alternativessome people have been thinking about alternatives and one of the ideas that is now there is idea of direct democracy this is the idea of bypassing politicians completely and having people both directly on issues i mean people vote directly on bills but this idea is naive because there's too many things that we will need to choose if you look at thereone hundred and fourteenth u s congress you will have seen that the house of representative considered more than six thousand bills the senate considered more than three thousand bills and they approve more than three hundred loss those will be many decisions that each person will have to make a week on topics that they know little about so there's a bigcognitive bandwidth problem if we're going to try to think about direct democracy as a viable alternativeso some people think about the idea of liquid democracy or fluid democracy which is idea that you endorse your political power to someone that can endorse it to someone else and eventually create a large follower network in which at the end there's a few people that are making decisions on behalf of all of their followers and their followersbut this idea also doesn't solve the problem of the county the bandwidth and to be honest is sort of quite similar to the idea of having a representative so what i'm going to do today is i'm going to be a little bit provocative and i'm going to ask you well what ifinstead of trying to bypass politicians will try to out to meet themthe idea of automation is not new it has started more than three hundred years ago when french weavers decided to automate the loomthe winner of that industrial award was yosef marija cap who was a french we were on merchant that married the loom with the steam engine to create autonomous loans and in those autonomous rooms he gained control he could now make fabrics that were more complex and more sophisticated than the ones that were able to do by handbut also by winning that industrial war he laid out what has become the blueprint of automationthe way they're welterweight things for the last three hundred years has always been the same we first identified a need then we create a tool to satisfy that need like the loom in this case and then we study how people use that tool to automate that user that's how we game from the mechanical roomdue to the autonomous loom and that took us one thousand years now is taken us only one hundred years to the same script to automate the carbut the thing is that this time around automation is kind of for real this is a video that a colleague of mine from toshiba shared with me that shows the factory that manufactures solid state drives the entire factory is a robot there are no humans in that factory and the robots are soon to leave the factories and become part ofof our world become part of our workforce so what i'm doing my day job is actually create tools that integrate data for entire countries so that we can ultimately have the foundations that we need for our future in which we need to manage also those machinesbut today i'm not here to talk to you about these tools that integrate data for countries but i'm here to talk to you about another idea that may help us think about how to use artificial intelligence in democracy because the tools that i build are designed for executive decisions these are decisions that can be cast in some sort ofterm of objectivity public investment decisions but there are decisions that are legislative and these decisions that are legislative require communication among people that have different points of view require participation required debate require deliberationand for a long time we have thought that well what we need to improve democracy is actually more communication so all of the technologies that we have advanced in the context of democracy whether our newspapers or whether it is social media have tried to provide us with more communication but we've been down that rabbit hole and we know that that's not what's going to solve the problembecause it's not a communication problem is that cognitive bandwidth problem so the problem is one of cognitive bandwidth well adding more communication to people is not going to be what's going to solve it what are we going to need instead is to have other technologies that help us deal with saml the communication that we are overloadedwith think of like a little avatar a software agent a digital gemini cricketthat basically is able to answer things on your behalfand if we would have that technology will be able to offload some of the communication and help maybe make better decisions or decisions at a larger scaleand the thing is that they'd be also virgins also is not new we already use them all the time we use software agents to choose the way that we're going to drive to a certain location the music that we're going to listen to or to get suggestions for the next books that we should readso there is an obvious idea on the twenty first century that was as obvious as the idea of putting together a steam engine with a loom at the time of jacquardand that idea is combining direct democracy with software agents imagine for a second a world in which instead of having a representative that represents you and millions of other people you can have a representative that represents only you with your neurons political views that weird combination of lawlibertarian or liberal and maybe a little conservative on some issues or maybe very progressive on others politicians nowadays are packages and they're full of compromises but you might have someone that can represent only you if you are willing to give up the idea that that representative is a human if that representatives are software agent we could havea senate that has as many senators as we have citizens and those senators are going to be able to read every bill and they want to be able to vote on each one of themso there is an obvious idea that maybe want to consider but i understand that in this day and age this idea might be quite scaryin fact thinking of a robot coming from the future to help us run our governments sounds terrifyingbut we've been there beforeand actually he was quite a nice guysohow would the jacquard loom version of this idea will look like so it would be a very simple system imagine a system that you log in and you create your avatar and then you're going to start training your avatar so you can provide your avatar with your reading habits or connected to your social media or you can connected to other data for examor by taking psychological test and the nice thing about this is that there's no deception you are not providing data to communicate with your friends and family that then gets use in a political system you are providing data to a system that is designed to be used to make political decisions on your behalf then you take that data and you chooseyou know a training algorithm because it's an open marketplace in which different people can submit different algorithms to predict how you're going to vote based on the data you have provided and the system is open so nobody controls the algorithms that are going to become more popular ones that become less popular and eventually you can audit the system you can see how your avatarif you like it you can leave it on autopilot if you want to be a little more controlling you can actually choose that they ask you every time that they going to make a decision or you can be anywhere in between one of the reasons why we use democracy so little may be because democracy has a very bad user interface and if we improve the user interface of democracy we might be ableto use it more of course there's a lot of questions that you might havewell how do you train the saboteurs how do you keep the data secure how do we keep the systems distributed and auditable however my grandmother is eighty years old and doesn't know how to use the internettrust me i've heard them all so when you think about an idea like this you have to beware of pessimists because they are known to have a problem for every solutionso what i want to invite you to think about the bigger ideas the questions that i just showed you are little ideas because our questions about how this would not work the big ideas our ideas of what else can you do with this is this would happen to work and one of those ideas is well hoorayit's the lossin the beginning we could have the avatars that we already have voting laws that are redeemed by the senators or politicians that we already have but if this were to work you could write an algorithm that could try to write a law that would get a certain percentage of approval and you could reverse the pross now you might think that this idea is ludicrous and we should not do it but you cannot deny that it's an idea that is only possible in a world in which direct democracy and soviet agents are a viable form of participationso how do we start a revolutionand with those started his revolution with picket fences or protest or by demand then our current politicians do we change into robots that's not going to work this is much more simpler much slower and much more humble we started the revolution by creating simple systems like this in grad schools in libraries in nonprofitwe try to figure out all of those little questions and those little problems that we're going to have to figure out to make this idea something viable to make this idea something that we can trust and as we create those systems that have one hundred people one thousand people one hundred thousand people voting in ways that are not politically binding we're going to develop trust in this idea the world isgoing to change and those that are as little as my daughter is right now are going to grow upand by the time that my daughter is my age maybe this idea that i know is to the very crazy might not be crazy to her and to her friends and at that point we will be at the end of our history but they will be at the beginning of theirs thank youthree
