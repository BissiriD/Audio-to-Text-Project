the you probably have the sense as most people do that polarization is getting worse in our country thatthe divide between the left and the right is as bad as it's been in really any of our lifetimes but you might also reasonably wonder if research backs up your intuition and in a nutshell the answer is sadly yesin study after study we find that liberals and conservatives have grown further apart they increasingly wall themselves off in these ideological silos consuming different news talking only to like-minded others and more and more choosing to live in different parts of the countryand i think that most alarming of all of it is seeing this rising animosity on both sides liberals and conservatives democrats and republicans more and more they just don't like one anotheryou see it in many different ways they don't want to befriend one another they don't want to date one another if they do they find out they find each other less attractive and they more and more don't want their children to marry someone who supports the other party particularly shocking statisticyou don't in my lab the students that i work with were talking about some social pot some sort of social pattern i'm a movie buff and so you know i'm often muffin like what kind of movie are we in here with this pattern so what kind of movie are we in with political polarization well could be a diseaseor moviecertainly seems like a disaster could be a war movie also fits but what i keep thinking is that we're in a zombie apocalypse movierightyou know the kind people wandering around in packs not thinking for themselves seized by this mob mentality is trying to spread their disease and destroy societyand you probably think as i do that you're the good guy in the zombie apocalypse movie right and all this hate and polarization is being propagated by the other people because we're brad pitt right freethinking righteous you know just trying to hold onto what we hold dear you know not footsoldiers in thearmy of the undead not that never thatbut here's the thing what movie do you suppose they think there isright well they absolutely think that they're the good guys in the zombie apocalypse movie right and the better believe that they think that they're brad pitt and that we we are the zombiesand who's to say that they're wrongi think that the truth is that we're all a part of this and the good side of that is that we can be a part of the solutionso what are we going to dowhat can we do to chip away at polarization in everyday life what can we do to connect with and communicate with our political counterparts well these are exactly the questions that i and my colleague matt feinberg became fascinated with a few years ago we started doing research on this topicand one of the first things that we discovered that i think is really helpful for understanding polarization is to understand that the political divide in our country is undergirded by a deeper moral divide so one of the most robust findings in the history of political psychology is this pattern identified by john height and jessiegraham psychologists that liberals and conservatives tend to endorse different values to different degrees so for example we find that liberals tend to endorse values like equality and fairness and care and protection from harm more than conservatives do and conservativesi tend to endorse values like loyalty patriotism respect for authority and moral purity more than liberals doand matinee were thinking that maybe this moral divide might be helpful for understanding how it is that liberals and conservatives talk to one another and why they so often seem to talk past one another when they do so we conducted a study where we recruited liberals to a study where they were supposed to write a persuasive essaysay that would be compelling to a conservative for in support of same sex marriage and what we found was that liberals tended to make arguments in terms of the liberal moral values of equality and fairness so they said things like everyone should have the right to love whoever they choose and day they beengay americans deserve the same equal rights as other americans overall we found that sixty nine percent of liberals invoked one of the more liberal moral values in constructing their essay and only nine percent in vote one of the more conservative moral values even though they were supposed to be trying to persuade conservativesand when we studied conservatives and had them make persuasive arguments in support of making english the official language of the u s a classically conservative political position we found that they weren't much better at this fifty nine percent of them made arguments in terms of one of the more conservative moral values and just eight percent invoked a liberal moral value even though they were supposed to be targetin liberals for persuasionnow you can see right away why we're in trouble here right people's moral values i mean they're at their most deeply held beliefs people are willing to fight and die for their values why are they going to give that up just to agree with you on something that they don't particularly want to agree with you on anywayif that persuasive appeal that you're making to your republican uncle means that he doesn't just have to change his view is going to change his underlying values to that's not going to go very farso what would work better well we believe it's a technique that we call moral reframing and we've studied it in a series of experiments in one of these experiments we recruited liberals and conservatives to a study where they read one of three essays before having their environmental attitudes surveyed in the firstof these essays was a relatively conventional pro-environmental essay that invoked the liberal values of care and protection from harm it said things like in many important ways we are causing real harm to the places we live in and it is essential that we take steps now to prevent further destruction from being done to our earthanother group of participants were assigned to read a really different essay that was designed to tap into the conservative value of moral purityis a pro environmental essay as well and it said things like keeping our forest drinking water and skies pure is of vital importancewe should regard the pollution of the places we live in to be disgustingand reducing pollution can help us preserve what is pure and beautiful about the places we liveand then we add a third group of participants who were assigned to read just a non political essay it was just a comparison group so we could get a baseline and what we found when we surveyed people about their environmental attitudes afterwards we found that liberals didn't really matter what essay they read they tend to have highly pro-environmental attitudes regardless liberals are on board for environmental protection conservatives whohowever were significantly more supportive of progressive environmental policies and environmental protection if they had read the moral purity essay than if they read one of the other two essays we even found that conservatives read the moral purity essay were significantly more likely to say that they believed in global warming and were concerned about global warmingeven though this essay didn't even mention global warming that's just a related environmental issue but that's how robust this moral reframing effect was and we've studied this on a whole slew of different political issues so if you want to move conservatives on issues like same sex marriage or nationalhealth insurance it helps to tie these liberal political issues to conservative values like patriotism and moral purityand we stayed at the other way too if you want to move liberals to the right on conservative policy issues like military spending and making english the official language of the u s it's you're going to be more persuasive if you tie those conservative policy issues to liberal moral values like equality and fairnessall these studies have the same clear message if you want to persuade someone on some policy it's helpful to connect that policy to their underlying moral valuesand you know when you say it like that it seems really obvious right like why why did we come here tonight whyit's incredibly intuitiveand even though it is it's something we really struggle to do it turns out then we go with that when we go to persuade somebody on a political issue we talk like we're speaking into a mirror we don't persuade so much as we rehearse our own reasons for why we believe some sort of political positionwe kept saying when we were designing these reframed moral arguments empathy and respect empathy and respect if you can tap into that you can connect and you might be able to persuade somebody in this countryso is thinking again about what movie we're inmaybe i got carried away before maybe it's not a zombie apocalypse moviemaybe instead it's a buddy cop moviei just roll with it just go with thisyou know the kind there's the white cop and a black cop or maybe a messy cop and an organized cop whatever it is they don't get along because of this difference but in the end when they have to come together and they cooperate the solidarity that they feel is greater because of that gulf that they had to cross rightand remember that in these movies it's usually worst in the second act when our leads are further apart than ever before and so maybe that's where we are in this country late in the second act of a buddy cop movietorn apart but about to come back togetherit sounds good but if we want it to happen i think the responsibility is going to start with us so this is my call to youlet's put this country back togetherlet's do it despite the politicians and the media and facebook and twitter and congressional redistricting and all of it all the things that divide uslet's do it because it's rightand let's do it because this hate and contempt that flows through all of us every day makes us ugly and it corrupts us and it threatens the very fabric of our societywe owe it to one another and our country to reach out and try to connectwe can't afford to hate them any longerand we can't afford to let them hate us eitherempathy and respect empathy and respect if you think about it it's the very least that we owe our fellow citizens thank youthree
