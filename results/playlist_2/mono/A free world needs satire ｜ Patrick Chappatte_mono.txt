the political cartoonist on the global stage for the last twenty years we have seena lot of things happen in those twenty years we thought three different catholic popesand we witness that uniquethe moment the election of a pope on st peter's square you know the little white smokeand the official announcementthen we saw four american presidents obama of course all europeans liked him a lot he was a mutual interest you favor diplomacy you wanted to be freehands with iranthreeand thenreality imitated carry catcher the day donald trump became the president of the united states of americathreepeople come to us and they say it's too easy for you cartoonistwith people like trump well no it's not easy to caricature a man who is insult a characterthough police are no easy target for satire because you try to nail them down one day and the next day they outdo you for example as soon as soon as he was elected i tried to imagine the tweet that trump would send on on christmashas eve so i did this okay and basically the next dayi basically the next day trump tweeted thislaughs it's the samethis this is the era of strong men and soon donald trump was able to meet his personal hero vladimir putin and this is this is how the first meeting wentthe i'm not inventing anything he came out of that first meeting saying that the two of them had agreed on a joint task force on cybersecurity this is true if you do remember oh who would have imagined the things we sawover these twenty years we saw great britain ran towards a european union exitiin the middle east we believed for awhile in the democratic miracle of the arab spring we saw dictators fall we saw others hang oniand then there's the timeless qing dynasty of north korea these guys seem to be coming straight out of cartoon network i was i was blessed to be able to draw two of them kim jong il the father when he died a few years ago that was a very dangerous momentthat and then the sun came along and proved himself a worthy successor to the throne is now friends with the u s president they meet each other all the time and they talklike friendsthreeshould we be surprised to believing in a world ruled by egomaniacs what if there were just a reflection of ourselves i mean look at us each of usyeah we love our smartphones we love our selfies we love ourselves and thanks to facebook we have a lot of friends all over the world mark zuckerberg is our friendiyou know he and his peers in silicon valley are the kings and emperors of our timeshowing that the emperor's new clothes has no clothes that's the task of satire writes speaking truth to power this has always been the historical role of political cartooning in the eighteen thirties post revolution friends under king louis phillipe journalists and caricaturists fought hardfor the freedom of the press they were jailed they were fine they did but they prevailed and this caricature of the king by domi came to define the monarch it marked history it became the timeless symbol of satire triumphing over autocracytoday to one hundred years after domi our political cartoons at risk of disappearingsee this blank space on the front page of turkish opposition newspapers shampoo idiots this is where musique cards cartoon used to appear in two thousand and eighteen musiker was sentenced to three years in jail for doing what for doing political cartoons in erdogan's turkeykey cartoon is from venezuela russia syria have been forced into exilelook at this imageit seems so innocent right yet it is so provocative when he posted this image how many of us knew it would change his life it was in two thousand and twelve and the syrians were taking to the streets of course the little red flower is the symbol of the signalrevolution so pretty soon the regime was after him and he had to flee the country a good friend of his cartoonist akram wrestling didn't make it out of syria he died under torturein the united states of america recently some of the very top cartoonists like nick anderson and rob rogers this is a cartoon by robthey lost their positions because their publishers fund their work to critical of trumpand the same happened to canadian cartoonist michael the other a maybe we should start worrying political cartoons were born with democracy and they are challenged when freedom isover the years with the cartooning for peace foundation and other initiatives kofi annan this is not well known he was the honorary chair of our foundation the late kofi annan nobel peace laureate he was a great defender of cartoons or on the board of the association of american editorial cartoonistswe have advocated on behalf of jail threatened fired exiled cartoonist but i never saw a case of someone losing his job over a cartoon he didn't dowell that happened to mefor the last twenty years i have been with the international herald tribune and the new york timesthen something happened in april two thousand and nineteen a cartoon by a famous portuguese person mr which was first published in newspaper real espresso in lisbon was piqued by an editor at the new york times and reprinted in the international editionsthis thing blew up it was denounced as anti semitic triggered widespread outrage apologies and a lot of damage control by the times a month after my editor told me there were ending political cartoons altogetherso we could and we should have a discussion about the cartoon some people say it reminds them of the worst anti semitic propaganda others including in israel say no it's just a harsh criticism of trump who's shown as blindly following the prime minister of israel i have some issues with this cartoon but thatthat discussion did not happen at the new york times under attack they took the easiest path in order to not have problems with political cartoons in the future let's not have any at allhey this is newwe just invent preventive self censorshipi think this is bigger than cartoons this is about opinion and journalism this in the end is about democracywe now live in a world where moralistic mobs gather on social media and rise like a star the most outrageous voices tend to defined the conversation and the angry crowd follows in these social media mobs sometimes fueled by inchfirst group fall upon newsrooms in an overwhelming blowthey send publishers and editors scrambling for counter measures this this leaves no room for meaningful discussions twitter is a place for fury not for debatebut you know what someone described pretty well our human condition in this noisy age you know whoshakespeare four hundred years agothis speaks to me shakespeare is still very relevant now but the world has changed a bitthat social media is both a blessing and a curse for cartoons this is the era of the image so they get shared they get viral but that also makes them appearprime targetsmore than often the real target behind the cartoon is the media that published itthat relationship between traditional media and social media is a funny one on one hand you have the time consuming process of information verification curation on the other hand it's an open debate frankly for rumors or opinions emotions amplified by algorithmseven quality newspapers mimic the codes of social networks on their website they highlight the ten most read the ten most shared stories they should put forward the ten most important storiesthat the media must not be intimidated by social media and editors should stop being afraid of the angry mobthough we're not going to put up warnings the way we do on cigarette packs are wecome onpolitical cartoons are meant to provoke just like opinions but before all they're are meant to be thought provoking you feel hurt just let it go you don't like it look the other wayfreedom of expression is not incompatible with dialogue and listening to each other but it is incompatible with intolerancethen let us not become our own sensors in the nave in the name of political correctness we need to stand up we need to push back because if we don't we will wake up tomorrow in a sanitized world where anya form of satire and political cartooning becomes impossible because politics when political pressure meets political correctness freedom of speech parishesthough do you remember january two thousand and fifteenwith the massacre of journalists and cartoonists at charlie hebdo in paris we discovered the most extreme form of censorshipthe murder remember how it feltwhatever one thought of that such a regular magazine however one felt about those particular cartoons we all sensed that something fundamental was at stake that citizens of free societies actually citizens of any society need humor as much as the air we breathethis is why the extremists you know the the dictators the autocrats and frankly all the ideology of the world cannot stand humorin the insane world we live in right now we need political cartoons more than everand we need humorthree
