thealright well let's start with an easy question how many of you are wearing a fitbit or an apple watch or some other kind of health tracking device and how many of you got a smartphone with you here today maybe i should say how many of you have not the fact the fact that so many of us have these technological marvels in our pockets or on our body is a sure sign ofthe revolution that's taking place in come and competing over the last decade and i want you to think with me for a second about the elements of that revolution so first off other data these devices are collecting data about our health our movements our habits and more and what's really important is that those data are not generic popelation data but the data that a personalized to us each has an individual second and just as important are the models inside these devices are very powerful mathematical and statistical models some of these models are learned entirely from data perhaps a machine learning model that has learned to codeclassify whether i'm running or walking or biking or sleeping some of these models are based in physics such as a physiological model that describes the equations that add that represent cardiac function or circadian rhythm and now when things get really interesting is where we start to put the dataand the models together mathematically this is known as data assimilation so we have data and we have models with data assimilation we start updating the models as new data are collected from the system and we don't do this update just once but we do it continually so as the systemchanges as i get older and my acadian rhythm or as my cardiac function is not what it once was the new data is collected and the models are evolving and following along with me now that data assimilation is really important because it's what personalizes the models to me and that then gets us to the forethoughtelement which is the element of prediction now that i have these personalized models it's so powerful because i can now get predictions or recommendations that are tailored to me as an individual and that are tailored to my dynamically evolving state over my life so that's that'swhat i'm describing this working together of data some data and models is likely very familiar to all of you because it's been driving your personal choices in retail and entertainment and wellness for many years but what you might not know is that a similar revolution has been taking place in engineering systems and in engineeringsystems the story is much the same we have data and we have increasing amounts of data as senses have become smaller lighter cheaper and more powerful and engineering we also have models our models are usually grounded in physics these models represent the governing laws of naturenature there are powerful models that let us predict how an engineering system will respond what you see up here on the slide as a picture of the unmanned aircraft that i have in my research group that we use for a great deal of our research and for this aircraft we have powerful finite element modelsthat let us predict how the aircraft's structure will respond under different conditions so these models let us answer questions like will the structure of the aircraft hold together on takeoff if i design it in this way or what happens if the aircraft wing gets damaged and i continue to fly it aggressivelywill the aircraft hold together and again just like the fitbit and the smartphone example we can put the data and the models together to build a personalized model of the engineering system a personalized model of the aircraft and we call this personalized model a digital twin so whatthere's a digital twin it is a personalized dynamically evolving model of a physical system and i want you to think about the digital twin of of my aircraft so as i create that digital twin i'm going to be collecting data from the sensors on board the aircrafti'm going to be collecting data from inspections i might make of the aircraft and i'm going to be assimilating that data into the models and what's really important is that i'm not building a generic model of just any old tele master aircraft i am building a personalized model of the very aircraft that is right now sitting inmy garage down the road in south austin and so that digital twin will capture the differences the variability from my aircraft to say my neighbors aircraft and what's more that digital twin will not be static it's going to change as my aircraft ages and degrades and gets damaged andgets repaired we will be assimilating data all the time and the digital twin will follow the aircraft through it's life so this is incredibly powerful i want you to imagine now that you're an airline or maybe in a few years' time you're an operator of a fleet of unmanned cargo delivery drones and imagine that you would have a digital twin likethis for every vehicle in your fleet and think about what that would mean for your decision making you could make decisions about when to maintain any one aircraft depending on the particular evolving state of that aircraft you could make decisions about how to optimally fly an aircraft on any given daya given the health of the aircraft given the mission needs given the environmental conditions that would really let you optimally manage that fleet of aircraftso this this idea of a digital twin is pretty neat the term digital twin was coined in two thousand and ten in a nasa report but the idea this idea of a personalized model combining models and data as much older and many people point to the apollo program as beingone of the places where digital twins were first put into practice so when the apollo program back in the sixties and the seventies nasa would launch apollo spacecraft beamed up into space and they would also deploy a simulator a virtual model on the ground in houston to follow along on the mission and now thisshe became very important and it became very useful in the apollo thirteen mission and again perhaps you all know the story because we've seen the movie and the apollo thirteen mission the spacecraft suffered a malfunction it was very badly damaged that became stranded up in space and so the story goes that nasa were able to take the daydata from the real aircraft the physical twin stuck up in space feed it into the simulator into the the virtual models on the ground in houston to the data assimilation dynamically evolve the simulators so now that it represented the conditions of the damaged spacecraft and then use that simulator to run produceactions and ultimately guide the decisions that brought the astronauts back home safely so more than fifty years later this idea now has a really great name the name of digital twins and what's really exciting is that it's moving well beyond just aerospace engineering so in our angeraeneid world we're starting to see digital twins of bridges and other civil infrastructure for structural health monitoring and predictive maintenance we're starting to see digital twins of buildings for energy efficiency digital twins of wind farms to increase efficiency and to reduce downtime in the natural world there's a lot of interestand creating digital twins of forests farms ice sheets coastal regions oil reservoirs and even talk of trying to create a digital twin of planet earth and in the medical world there's a great deal of interest in creating digital twins to help guide medical assessment diagnoseisis personalized treatment and in silico drug testing so many many exciting potential applications of digital twins but now i would not like you to leave my talk today thinking that all of this as a reality that we can create digital twins today have all those complex systems it's still bebeyond reach to create a digital twin of an entire aircraft it's still beyond reach to create a digital twin of a constipation or of planet earth creating digital twins of these very very complex systems is very very challenging and let's think for a minute why it's so challengingso one reason it is very difficult is because of the scales that these systems cause if you think about my aircraft damage at the microscopic level on the material on the wing of the aircraft translates across scale to impact the way the vehicle flies at the vehicle level in medicine whywe all know that again changes at the very fine level at the at the molecular or the cellular level and our bodies translate across scales to have impacts on us at the system level at the human level and computational models that resolve all of these scales from the micro-scale all the way up to the system levelare computationally intractable we can't solve them even with today's supercomputing power but then you might say okay well what about the data you said we had a lot of data can we not just learn digital twins from data so yes we live in an era of big data and we have a lot of data often for all systems but when it comes to these vvery challenging complex systems and engineering and science and medicine the data by themselves are almost never enough the data are almost always very sparse in both space and in time the data are almost always noisy and they're indirect as an engineer i canit's never measure what it is i want to know if i want to know about the health on the structure inside my aircraft wing i can't just break it open and take a look i am limited to those few senses that are on the surface of the wing taking those measurements and then trying to guess more than gates trying to infer what's happening inside the wing the same astrue in medicine a medical practitioner can't open somebody up to take a look at an organ again we are limited to spice noisy and indirect observations taken from the outside to try to infer what's going on so then you might say well we just have to wait a few years because syncing technology will get better and betterand better and that that's truemaybe maybe then we'll have enough data to really be able to characterize what is going on inside these very complex systems but even that's not enough because all that would tell us is what's happening now and remember we have to do more than that we have to be able to predict what might happen in the future if we take different differentactions so we're always going to need the models so that sounds like a huge challenge and indeed it is but the good news is that we have a lot of hope for addressing this challenge and a big part of this hope rests on this notion of predictive physics based models these are the models that encode the governing lawsof nature that let us make predictions predict how a cancer tumor might grow or how a cancer tumor might respond to radiotherapy treatment or predict how an antarctic ice sheet might flow under different future temperature scenarios and bringing these predictive physics based models togetherwith powerful machine learning with scalable methods and data assimilation and optimization and decision making and with high performance computing that's the realm of the interdisciplinary field of computational science and that's the focus of the oden institute here at u t austin where we bring together faculty from twenty four different departments across keycampus to tackle these kinds of challenging problems so i'm going to close by provoking your imagination and i hope you're excited like i am about the idea of a digital twin and maybe as you go home you can look around and think ooh what if we had a digital twin of that but let's look at some examples of some of the really exciting ehareas with digital twins could make a difference in tackling some of the biggest problems facing society and as i go through this you'll also see some of the really exciting research that we have going on here at u t austin so the first area is space systems you probably all know we are at the dawn of a new space era it is so exciting and it's so exciting for our stewartscience and what's even more exciting is that central texas is right in the midst of that new era so digital twins clearly have a role to play in managing the health and the operations of us based systems of launch vehicles of satellites you can see here this is some of the work that i'm doing together with my colleagues from thecockerel school or not as an idiot and should have asked bit of her digital twins also have a big role to play in tracking and managing space objects in space debris and here at u t austin we have one of the world's leading experts in this area that's mareeba mark mareeba is building digital twins for space domainawareness if we think about the environment and geosciences again digital twins could play such a role here this picture you see omega tosses high resolution physics space model of the antarctic ice sheet which is put together with observational data of all different kinds to understand what might begoing on to help guide decisions about where to to drill ice cores way to take observations and ultimately to inform the decision making around all our future climatewe see also here the work of clint dawson in building a digital twin of a coastal area here the the the gulf coast again combining powerful physics models with all the different kinds of data and here focused on making storm surge modeling for hurricanes even more accurate again in support ofcritical decision making and they didn't medicine i think it's pretty clear that digital twins have such a role to play in realizing the promise of personalized medicine here we see some of the work of michael sacks from our oden institute wilson center and moving towards patient specific personalized heart careand the work of tommy ankle of and david homos also and the the urban institute also with working with dow medical school and part of biomedical engineering and building digital twins for cancer patients so i hope that helps too as i said provoke your imaginations to think about what might be possible i personally couldb could not be more excited about a future world where digital twins are enabling safer more efficient engineering systems they're enabling a better understanding of the natural world around us and there are enabling better medical outcomes for all of us as an individual thank youthree
