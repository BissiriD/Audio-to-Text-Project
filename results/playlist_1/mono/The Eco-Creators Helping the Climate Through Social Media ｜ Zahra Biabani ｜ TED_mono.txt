thei recently graduated college where i studied environmental science and environmental sociology now during one of my many many finals week study breaks i came across something that piqued my interest and it wasn't something i was supposed to be studying it was a survey of ten thousand young people across ten different countries on their feelingsregarding the climate crisis a survey found that fifty six percent of gen-z years the generation that i'm a part of and the largest age demographic in the world believe that because of the climate crisis humanity is doomedthis kind of felt like a punch in the gut i mean i had just spent four and a half years tens of thousands of dollars to studying these things countless time and are organizing on and off campus and energy getting involved with both local and national groups yet most of my generation viewed it all as pointlessnow if we look at the way that younger generations talk about the climate crisis these feelings of doom and despair make sense i mean we're drowning in bad climate news headline after headline detail each week's latest catastrophe unprecedented has taken on a new meaning as each day is unprecedented just count how many times you'll payprobably hear it today i gave you two one for free right thereand everything is amplified on social media where there's a remarkable lack of nuance and an oversupply of attention grabbing rhetoric many of us including myself seem to believe that if we just share these awareness posts enough times that someone somewhere will finally do something about it but unfortunately joe biden probably doesn't follow you on instbagram and he doesn't follow me either yeti'm part of a diverse nineteen person strong collective called eco talk and we use social media to share nuanced climate education through infographics memes and you guessed it take talks to our collective audience of over four million people most of whom are genji and millennials and through our work we've picked up on this pattern our common sections arefilled with people who have given up hopepeople who say they have weekly cut anxiety attacks about the climate crisis or that they don't want to have kids anymore out of fear of adding to the suffering or that they see no point in taking action when the powers that stand against us are so strongour generation and younger generations need a new way of addressing the climate crisis that unshackled us from the cycles of doom and gloom that so often lead to inaction because we cannot play a part in making change if we do not believe that change is possible climate denialism which for decades has been peddled by oil gas and other big business interests has met it's rivalclimate dualism the belief that we cannot save our planet so why take action though they different origin both have the ability to paralyze action and prevent progress and those things are bad they're far from over so how do we find hope when things feel hopeless and how do we communicate the inextricable link betweenhope and action to answer this let me take you back to march of two thousand and twenty absolutely no one's first choice of one to time travel tomany of us were quarantined in our homes people had stopped going out and socializing yet the stream and virality of bad news certainly had not stopped i was finishing up my semester at home as well as working to move my activism online when i was hit not only was covered but also with burnout i began to cryquestion the efficacy of my work my passion for environmentalism and the purpose in studying what i was studyingi knew i needed something to inspire me i was scrolling on social media and i saw a friend who had been sharing positive news stories i paired this with the rise and feel good dance videos that have really emerged on tiktok and started a series called weekly earth wins here's a look at one of those videoslaughs so at first this felt really really silly i mean what did they interesting have to do with climate action and what good was sharing good news when everything felt so bad but then i began to receive people's feedback people told methat these videos really helped mitigate their climate anxiety that they looked forward to these videos week after week and that these videos helped turn their anger and anxiety into action so i continued making them and the process of finding good news stories to share i began to pick up on trends week after week institutions were divestfrom fossil fuels week after week land was given back to indigenous communities and week after week states were implementing renewable renewable energy standardsi never overlooked the scientific projections or data rather tuned into the hard to find good news stories and examples of successful on the ground work and in the process i uncovered the framework that i have been yearning for climate optimismclimate optimism is a framework based on the idea that despite the bleak projections and the high stakes we can restore our planet back to health and in doing so protect all that inhabited claim a optimism is what gives us hope when things feel hopeless is what sustains us in our pursuit of sustainability is what fuels us in the uphill battle of trendslistening away from fossil fuels it's also what gives us the energy to continue fighting for our successes virtually the zero emissions energy source that nobody talks aboutso in this process i realize also that climate optimism is not for everybodyclimate optimism is not for politicians who have stalled an action or corporations who have incessantly pursued profits over people to them my message is clear listen to science and act now stop failing the citizens and people that you have a duty to serverather climate optimism is for those of us here today that have dedicated our lives to fighting the greatest battle of our time but also to the part time activists those who do what they can when they can and perhaps most significantly to the marginalized communities and people in the global south who frankly don't have time to get stuck in the cycles of dodoom and gloomthe need for climate optimism has never been more urgent if we limit our vision of the future to one filled with oil rigs smokestacks and suffering we limit our capacity and shirk our duty to change the course of humanity for the better by looking for good and working towards the good we are empower ourselves to be agents of goodin the fight for the future that we deserve the alternative giving up hope only relinquishes power into the very entities that have gotten us into this mess luckily i'm not alone in championing this movement my friends at eco talk provide a great example of a diverse set of backgrounds experiences and voices coming togetheror to encourage this generation and the next here's a look at some of our workcanada is banning six types of plastic the plastics includes grocery bags thirty six six pack rings reusable food containers straws and utensils now hopefully they put some systems in place for some people who need those things for accessibility purposes but this is a step in the right directionand i'm excitedfrom desertification to bountiful vegetation a community in sierra brazil has been able to rehabilitate their landscape using amazing collective action and funding from from semi water is flowing crops are growing and you can truly see a differenceandwelcome back to mitri ashbery every time i step outside i should trash and litter on the ground and i hate it so let's clean them up i got my trash bagslet's go we got two three fourbut all this trashing this greek toomuch better storm grids like that is exactly our trash enters the ocean and we don't want that there are already over five point two five trillion piecesoceans let's not let it any morelaughs we're not naive we know the details in the data that speak to the devastation of the climate crisis like the back of our hands because it's our future to inherit but we also know that the future wereserve cannot be built on the unstable foundations of fear and anxietyit must be built with one of the few infinite resources that we have on this finite planet hope so we choose climate optimism we choose to fight for the future that we deserve and i hope you will too thank youthree
