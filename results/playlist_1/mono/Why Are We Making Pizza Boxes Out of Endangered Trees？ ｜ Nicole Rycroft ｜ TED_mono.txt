theperhaps it's surprising that as a professional tree hugger i'm going to be speaking to you about supply chains they don't sound very sexy but when it comes to stabilizing our climate supply chains are the hottest topic on the planet and that's because more than half of our society's carbon footprint can be a tripmuted to the impact of supply chains and specifically the raw materials that products are made from we have built our societies around take make waste production systems the fossil fuel industry plastics industrial forestry and paper these are massive global supplythe changes that have shaped our world they've left deep scars across landscapes legacies of pollution and push species and coaches to the brink of extinction now on the other hand we have game changing solutions brilliant innovations that use ninety percent less water and fifty percent less energybut this stuck at small scale because they can't secure the financing that they need to commercialize nor the markets that underpin this success it's the classic chicken and egg situation and even with slow progress we're losing ground to the climate crisis and biodiversity lossthis at a moment when we need all hands on deck for our planet we must scale solutions and we must scale them quickly and this is not just about doing less bad that time has passed we need the two point oh industrial revolution one that sets us on course to operate andlive within the natural bounds of our planet and so overhauling these huge and powerful entrenched industrial systems it can appear daunting but i've seen how change can be successful up close with work that i've been doing for the past twenty years for my organizationcanopy our focus is on protecting the world's ancient and endangered forests and transforming the massive pulp paper packaging and viscous supply chains that the principles from those supply chains can be applied to any sector in need of change keeping forests standing is one of the fansthe cheapest most effective ways for us to stabilize our climate but of course we can't keep far standing if we keep mowing them down to make pizza boxes and rayon t-shirts the surge in e-commerce and fashion derived from tree based textiles like rayon and viscose is driving the destructocean of climate critical forests and creating mountains of discarded textiles and packaging we must move our supply chains out of forest ecosystems and to do that we need to change the business practices of thousands of brands and that's where we come in cacanopy works to create the market conditions for change by working with hundreds of the forest industry's largest customers first to eliminate the use of ancient and endangered forest fiber from their packaging in their textile supply chains and now increasingly to introduce lower carbon socircular and nexgen alternatives get rid of the bad phase in scale up the good these companies are often fierce competitors in the rest of their business operations but they're willing to come together in a pre competitive space because they know that no single company no matter howhow large they are can transform an entire supply chain by themselves nor can they solve the climate crisis and the ceos of these companies suppliers giant companies responsible for ninety per cent of global viscous production and half of packaging can sit around aa single board room table imagined that the outsized influence of this small group of suppliers can unlock ambitious levels of change through their collective supply chains and of course the same can be said for other sectors as well supply chain transformation starts when you have a critical massof brands telling their supplies that they need to change that they have zero tolerance for packaging and textiles that originate from the world's endangered forests that they want lower carbon circular next gen tentative and giving their suppliers at a short timeline to achieve that targetin this strong market pull through for low carbon alternative creates the value proposition for conventional producers to change business as usual practice to fund the new tech to develop the systems to replace tree fiber with these lower carbon more circular feedstocks like discarded keyclothing and agricultural residues and then to build the systems to make sure that these new feedstocks can then make their way to the new next jim pope mills a canopy we call this strategy survival a pulp thrillerthank youso industry leaders demand change suppliers respond it creates value that moves investment the pipeline of solutions is buoyed and you have a supply chain well on it's way to sustainable change canopies only work greening the harry potter book series has grown to workking with brands that represent a trillion dollars these companies are changing the packaging and the viscous textiles that they're buying based on the environmental qualities and it is this leverage that has enabled us to shift more than half of global viscose out of the world's ancient and endangered foreststhen and now we're working with our brand partners with conventional produces with investors and with brilliant innovators to scale climate resilient supply chains for the twenty first century and in fact the world's first next genmill is now up and running it's a giant industrial mill built in the bones of an old shuddered windmill in northern sweden and rather than requiring huge swaths of forests to be cut every year renew sell will use hundreds of millions of old jeans and t-shirts it's re employed one hundred peoplewill it uses ninety percent less water and five tonnes less carbon per ton of product compared to a conventional tree based ram renew cell is a spectacular swords to plowshares example and it is the first of hundreds of next gen mills that are on track to be operational bytwenty thirty as our strategy unfolds and boosted by the generous support of the ted community it's heartening and remarkable to see the viscous supply chain transforming in real time and proving that solutions are indeed sexy but it mustn't stop there because menany of our production systems and supply chains are unsustainable and in need of change the food system plastics paper based packaging for every sector there is a more sustainable path forward and the solutions and the people needed to make them happen are often closer than we thinkwhen we create the right market conditions change can happen exponentially and quickly carbon intensive supply chains are relics of the twentieth century let's leave them back there thank youthree
