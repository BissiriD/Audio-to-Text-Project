thethe core of the earth is six thousand degrees celsius the same temperature as the surface of the sun but it's not ninety four million miles away like the extraterrestrial sun as it is right here beneath our feetreally literally right there but we don't think about this right i mean when you go outside you walk barefoot you don't burn your feet the earth's crust an incredible insulator and it keeps this massive inexhaustible heat source beneath us invisible but if you've ever visited icelandor an active volcano you've got geysers and steam vents and lava these are surface manifestations of the incredible amount of heat that lies beneath us anywhere and everywhere in the world and we don't have to drill very far to reach temperatures that far exceed what we would needto power the world thousands of times over for all of civilizationpretty cool rightsowe gotta get to it how do we do that let's cap it let's tap it fast i'm a climate activist i am very worried about climate change it keeps me up at night so we need to make this happen rightso howso i'm here with good news about that and also a proposition let's do the good news firstthere are teams of innovators right now in the field that are working on figuring out how to most efficiently and effectively tap this enormous heat source beneath usand they are running sprints and i'm not talking about the type of geothermal that you find in iceland that's easy to get to it's shallow it's close to the surface and in those places in the world we already have geothermal energy i'm talking about making geothermal energy accessible anywhere and everywhere in the worldthat energy is needed but in order to do that we've got to figure out how to mimic the conditions that occur in places like iceland right that make geothermal easy to tap and extract and harvest and those conditions are hot rocks poor space in the rocks andand water filling those pores those conditions seem simple but they actually occur naturally in very very few places in the world right and that's why we don't have geothermal energy everywhere we have it in in just a few places but the past couple of decades there have been really disruptive and bbreakthrough technological innovations that enable us to engineer the subsurface to mimic mother nature's geothermal so technological innovations like high pressure and temperature drilling technologies that were developed for offshore oil and gas exploration technologies like directional drillingwere no longer we can just drill straight down but instead we can actually turn and steer drill bits to reach very precise and specific locations in the subsurface miles underground and we can also fracture rock now which means that we can create poor space where poor space does notexist naturally so if you take these innovations that i just listed and you put them all together you end up enabling entirely new breed of scalable geothermal concepts geothermal concepts can be done anywhere in the world so for instance now we have engineered geothermal systems or e g s in thisconcept several wells are drilled at the bottom of the well the rock is fractured it creates a reservoir under the surface think of it as a pot where you boil your water underground right you send a fluid down it percolates through the fractures it comes back up really hot and we use it for all sorts of interesting and important things like howheating buildings directly or we can run it through a turban to produce electricity now eg s can take a lot of forms this is an area of intense innovation right now you can engineer these systems in a variety of ways but the basic concepts stay the same then we have closed loop systems closed loops are pretty new it's another really hot area of innovation same concept basic as egyes you have one or more wells drilled you create a reservoir underground but in closed loops instead of fracturing to create that reservoir underground it's entirely drilled like a radiator in the rock and they take many forms to just like e g s check it out you can see in closed loop systems how useful it is to be able to turnand steer that drillbit right totally enabling in terms of getting these concepts to work another really cool aspect of closed loop systems another fierce area of innovation right now is what we're putting in these systems as the working fluid to harvest the heat most of the time it's waterbut what if we could optimize a fluid to perform better than water so it heats up faster than water at lower temperatures than water and the really cool thing about closed loops is the going candidate right one everybody loves right now to put in these systems to most efficiently harvest heat is actually a substance thatthe center of our climate angst right now is a to round us in excess and abundance it's ceo to supercoolso then there's hybrids not the cars geothermal hybrids you take the best of both worlds right you get the increased surface area and heat that you get from fracturing rock you combine that with a closed loop well designed so you can use that optimized fluid the goal of hybrid systems is to extract the most heat minimizedrilling costs so that's what's happening right now a lot of innovation it's really really cool but these concepts none of them are without their technology challengesbut y'all these are not moon shots they are not moon shots we are talking about making very incremental changes to existing technologies methods and techniques with an eye on more hotter and deeper geothermal development and thehe's also aren't just ideas there are teams right now in the field demonstrating these concepts teams like sage geosystems a team that i mentor this is a well that they are demonstrating this summer and get this texas not in iceland not on the side of a volcano not in the ringfire this is a texas pasture where you would never suspect the enormous geothermal resources that lie below and this well is an existing abandoned oil and gas well that they have repurposed for this geothermal demonstration if all goeswell with this demonstration by twenty twenty two that is next year they will have a geothermal power plant in texas there are dozens of examples like this right now in the field these are all startups they're out there proving geothermal concepts new technologies new drilling the concepts thati showed you in the slight we are in the midst of a geothermal renaissance in the past eighteen months more geothermal startups have launched in the past ten years combinedif even one of these startups is successful at proving a scalable geothermal concept we are literally off to the races in developing this massive reliable twenty four seven clean energy source anywhere in the world and buy off to the races i mean that right like we gotta gothe clock is ticking we need scale it's going to be cute if it works but we've got to have global scale so how do we do thatbrings me my propositionso turns out that there is an industry that is perfectly positioned to take us from the few geothermal power plants we have today to the hundreds of thousands that we need to meet demandthe industry that everyone loves to hate who cares about the environment and climateis that industry to scale geothermal what do we need to do we need to efficiently effectively and safely drill below the surface over and over and over and over again and who does that now the oil and gas industry does that now the oiland gas industry is a global specialized workforce of millions backed by almost two hundred years of breakthrough technological innovation all aimed at exploring for drilling for and producing energy from deep undergroundand you flip the switch and you have green drillingan oil and gas keeps its current business model the business model that keeps them firmly rooted in hydrocarbons now they're doing what they know how to do which is exploring for drilling for and producing a sub surface energy assetbut what we're talking about here is a pivot from hydrocarbons to heat a global workforce of millions highly skilled and trained doesn't need to be retrained they can keep doing what they already know how to do but this time around for cleanif we're able to pull this off and team up to do it we are talking about the ability to meet world energy demand we are talking about the ability over the next few decades to put more geothermal energy on the grid than we currently have in dirty energygeothermal energy at oil and gas scaleso i bet i know what some of you are thinking because i was that person too like i used to think it and so i will tell you how i got from there to here i used to feel that we just needed to let the oil and gas industry go awayso i i'm a climate activist and a lifelong environmentalist the kind that would have chained myself to a tree if i needed to have that flavor i grew up and got a job became an energy lawyer and then an energy entrepreneur and entrepreneurship took me out into the field for product deployments andi ended up living on drill rigs and i had a complete epiphany it was a total mind shit bias out the door because i got to know many individuals in the oil and gas workforce and y'all that grit i mean it has incredible grit those people aretherefore it but i also got to know the amazing technological innovations of that industry and what i've come to believe is those are assets the workforce the technologies they are assets that we can leverage now to solve climate change so what i do for my jobjob is i recruit oil and gas veterans to the cause of geothermalif we want to turn the ship we recruit the sailors and it's working so there's good news do you remember that slide i showed you with all the startups the geothermal startups that are in the field a good many of those teams are actually oil and gas veterans sage geosystems with their texas wellwell that is an all oil and gas team with almost three hundred years of collective experience at entities like shell bp halliburton and weatherford yall that is really interesting right i mean that world take notice because what this is isoil and gas brains actively reinventing themselves using everything they know that they learned in their entire oil and gas experience to solve climate change but it's also interesting because this new flourish of entrepreneur oil and gas veteran turned geothermal entrepreneuris helping the oil and gas industry engage actively with this problem set they speak the language of oil and gas they understand the business models of oil and gas they are out building partnerships and relationships with oil and gas entities that are based on decades of trust and experience they have with one another inthe past six months geothermal startups have closed more than one hundred million dollars in funding deals with oil and gas entities as funding partnerswe are at the beginning of a huge and exciting shift here if it's the best and brightest minds in oil and gas who are off launching geothermal companies then y'all this very well may be the future of the oil and gas industry itself but here's my worryso say oil and gas grabs the reins here takes us to global scale fast exponential growth we put terawatts of geothermal energy on the gridare we going to fight about thisthe thing that i love about geothermal is that it gives us all a way around ourselves right away around extreme polarizationenvironmentalists and drillers dogs and cats right and left we all get what we want clean energy where we need it climate change solve energy poverty solved and drillers keep drilling if we build the right collaborations hereand unite behind a shared vision we solve energy in the next thirty years we change the conversation from worrying about whether we're going to meet twenty fifty climate goals to how they look kind of lazy we can do thiswe've just got to we've just got to drill the limitthank youthree
