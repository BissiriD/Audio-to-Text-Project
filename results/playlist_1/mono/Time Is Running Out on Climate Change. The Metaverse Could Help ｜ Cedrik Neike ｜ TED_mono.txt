theif it isn't to all of this my question is are we too latei'm half german and i hate being late to be very honest so it's something which gets me sort of all round up but the reality is if we look at that we're running out of time we have have real issues reaching the one point five degrees of parents well there's one issue but we're not only running out of time we also running out of resources to threea week from now three weeks on the second of august we will reach the world overshoot day meaning we will have used up all of the replenishable resources of this planetthat's not good read these are real problems now i'm an engineer and we engineer love to solve problems that's what we do but the reality is as if we go to the real world we will not be able to solve those problems doing everything in the real world as we've done it before now a lot of us including my kids and myself and a third of the willpowerablation escape into digital worlds there are three billion gamers out there right we lose timebut what if what if i would tell youthat we could use the digital worldto cheat time in the real world and to make things better and faster with less resourcesyou are telling me well how does it work cedric and i will tell you the following now in the physical world the laws of physics apply right i'm an industry so what do we do we dig up the earth we get stuff out we ship it around the world we melted we assemble it and then we try if it works and then we try again if it works if not we docheck out more stuff we are basically are having a try and arrow sort of approach lots of time lots of resources have been used it took us more than one hundred years to build the combustion engine carin the digital world it's a bit different we could have a digital playground we can learn things without being bound by the laws of physics we can replicate the complete real world and start experimenting itand the one thing we can is we will not learn one times faster not ten times faster we will learn a million times faster even more we are only limited by how much compute power we throw at a problemso the thing we have is is how do we make it we'll so how do we cheat time to do more with lesswe're using all too much fossil fuels we're not using enough renewables and we all know that batteries is the answer to be able to help us sort of store and distribute this renewable energynow the problem was batteries is that there's a lot of investment going into batteries manufacturing at the moment since two thousand and nineteen three hundred billion dollars are being put into batteriestwo hundred giga factories are being built because we need to build ten billion batteries per year in two thousand and thirtyand just to give you an overview a gigafactory basically you take two eiffel towers put them next to each other that's the size of a gigafactory which is out theregig avatar on how french so that's when i want to say something is really baker take a couple of eiffel towers so two eiffel towers two next to each other now imagine two hundred of those giga factories which are being built they need to build the right batteries they need to do this in the right way and they need to recycle themnow how can we apply this technology very simple first thing we will do is we will in this let's call it industrial metaverse build the perfect battery will experiment with this chemistry with how it needs to be built and we will solve the problems we have one province i dunno if any of you came with an eevee here you probably dodidn't like your charging time so i brought a little example for you so let me share this example so this is basically a module which goes into a pack it's actually an a car battery if we're capable of of of cooling this car battery thirty percent fasteror better you can charge your cars twice as fast so we could actually save time with less resources and all of this simulation can be done not in years it can be done in weeks in without building a single battery that's the first thingthe second thing is actually building batteries the traditional way uses a lot of energy lots of water lots of resources and produces lots of scrapthat's not good if you go to a traditional i mean making a battery is like making a cake i'm sorry for all of the battery experts in the room but it's baking cakes basically what you do is you take a lot of ingredients you mix them up in the factory of somebody listening to the sound yep yep yep that's about right if it's true you put it onto an aluminium foil which gets folded which gets pedanticcasing dried outthe problem is that if the person listened to it the wrong way you can throw away five days seven days of battery production and this is in the giga factories of rudy back then so what do we do that's my second example we built this giga factories completely in the metaverse in the digital world's first and we simulate we simulate how wedo actually the chemistry how does this floor can we get the information we don't need to listen to it how do we optimize the different steps this is a gigafactory for example which is going to be built so we build this gigafactory in the metaverse first to make sure that it produces it in the right way and once we have the real factory the metaverse factory runs in parallel and learns fromfaster than the real world turnaround from so we dream up a better battery we make a better battery and then the last one we have to recycle the battery we have to reuse itso i'm hoping that all of you are collecting your batteries to bring them back in germany to the supermarket for recycling rightreality if if you have a bag of twenty batteries if it's lithium i am only one will be recyclednineteen will be thrown awayonly five percent of all batteries are actually being recycled at the momentand what we can do if we have a digital twin on building this better at designing the battery building the battery is we can have a digital twin with each battery saying that's me this is how i've been built this is my components this is how you can repair me this is how i can be sort of disassembled and you can automate it so we can actually take ninety five percent or plusof the battery back into the processnow this battery for example is just to give you a view on how we can design how we can sort of build and how we can we use it in a better way now the problem is i gave that speech to my kids and my my kids basically said look that we're computer scientists this has been done for the last forty years what's new about itso i'm like okay what's new is that we are now throwing huge amount of cloud computing and ai to it so every industry can use this capabilityi'll give you three examples first one at travel three to four percent of worldwide c o two we're working with small startups which are building completely electrical plates completing the metaverse first to build them rightsecond one so we build better travel we can use it for better foodsit's twenty five percent of all c o two is being used in agriculture so this is an example i brought with you we can build giga factories for food this has vertical farms completely automated these farms use one hundred percent renewables they use ninety five percent less water zero pesticides right and it tastes actually quite goodand it's completely ultimate and you say what does it have to do with a digital twin we have a twin of each plant which means we can make every day a perfect day for these plantspretty goodnow the last exampleit's going to be shocking to you but you should think about it you're going to you're spending ninety percent of your living time in buildings nine zeroin buildings which have been badly designed badly built and badly runyou eat it when it shouldn't be heated you call it when it shouldn't be cooler to leave the lights on so it's a huge waste of resources thirty percent of all energy goes into buildings so we can use those tools to design houses better to simulate what needs to be done to build them in a better way so they don't have to be changed multiple times and to run thembut being here in detroit we can also do it for complete parts of the city which is my last example this is a of i come from berlin this is an old industrial part of this town which we are going to rebuild completely and what we decided as we going to rebuild at first in the metaverse because we wanted to optimize where does the excess heat goes where's the exitcooling going what happens if the rainfalls how can we keep it what is the biosphere looking at why does the biodiversity can we make it wheelchair accessible so we optimize it's a once we build this part of berlinit's going to be really sort of optimized and we will not have made mistakes we are getting a platinum elite certification before this thing is even being builtso why am i sharing with issuei told you as a german i hate being late right but the reality a lot of the industries you are working in are late or late to do their contribution to make sure that we are reaching the paris accords so there's tools which enabled us to cheat time and to do more with less we should use those toolsso my ask of all of us let's use those tool make it a better world and have an impact thank youthree
