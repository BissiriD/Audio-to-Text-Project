theone of the hallmarks of living in a technologically advanced society is even the little details of life that seem mundane end up being astonishing like the fact that it takes five gallons of water to produce a walnut or that half the plastic that's ever been made has been made in the past fifteen years my favoritethese examples is what it takes to keep a room room temperature allow me to explain heating is generally done by combusting fossil fuel so first we have to find the fuel unfortunately it tends to be buried more than a kilometer under the earth's surface and all too often in inconvenient places like the arctic circle nations in conflict or allfor the bottom of the ocean and then there's the fact that the substance takes sixty to six hundred million years to form from dead plankton so there's that issue we drilled these incredibly deep holes to get it then we pipe it truck it and ship it in tankers across the world to refineries which are these incredibly expensive industrial facilitiesthat taking crude oil and gas which are just a bunch of different hydrocarbon molecules in order to sort those molecules into refined products refined natural gas is then delivered to homes and businesses via an invisible interstate highway system millions of miles long it's invisible because it's underground there's soso much pipeline in this system that entire steel mills have been built only to produce pipeline for the system and because there are millions of miles of gas getting pumped beneath us at high pressure at all times engineers send these intelligent robots called smart pigs through the pipelines to check for safetybeck's doing this is called pigging the pipeline yeah that's a real thing but even with these precautions there are accidents in two thousand and ten the san bruno natural gas pipeline exploded in california eight people died eye witnesses reported the blast like a wall of fire a thousand feet tall moremore recently in two thousand and eighteen excess pressure and natural gas pipelines in massachusetts resulted in explosions that killed somebody enforced fifty thousand others from their homes but you know despite all of this we're actually jealous of people who live close enough to these insane pipelines to get gas into their homes because everyone elsestuck with even worse options like fuel oil and propane these fuels don't have pipelines in place for delivery so instead tens of thousands of trucks go from home to home and neighborhoods throughout the country pumping these fuels into tanks in homeowners basements and yards and regardless of what heating fuel you use gas propane or oilyou better have a carbon monoxide detector so your heating system doesn't accidentally kill you in the night because hundreds of americans die in exactly that way each year so that's the system we have today safe to say it has some downsides don't get me wrong it's a marvel of human ingenuity but with some pretty serious drawbacks andrigmarole of conventional heating fuels even more over the top when you consider that every home is already sitting right on top of a vast reservoir of renewable energy geothermal energy let's talk about geothermal energy starting a few feet under the earth's surface the ground is awash in thermal energy this is why caves and whyand sellers they never get too hot or too cold they're just bathed in this low grade heat geothermal heating systems draw on this heat using what are called ground loops which are just simple plastic pipes buried under the yard these ground loops are then connected to a heat pump that sits inside the home typically where a furnace once was more and more homeowners are choosinggeothermal over fuel based options i see this shift up close every day because i cofounded a company to create a new kind of ground up utility by making it as easy and inexpensive as possible to switch from conventional heating to geothermal we've done this by creating a service where homeowners can fill out a form on our website we design a geothermal heatthe system for them and then we install that system using purpose built tools and equipment once the installation is done that home will have moved on from fossil heating forever because those ground loops the lasts as long as the home itself as each home switches over a new kind of utility is taking hold a distributed utility made up of homes exchanging renewable energywith the ground this new infrastructure is simple local and inexpensive to operate and it represents a permanent and wholesale shift away from fossil fuels the groundwork is being laid so to speak for the idea that maybe we don't need to destroy the world in order to keep our rooms at a comfortable temperature let's leave the arctic circle insee flora alone bypass the refineries pipelines and stop worrying that our families will accidentally be poisoned in the night instead let's use the massive amounts of energy that are already right there for the taking right beneath every building on earth thank you
