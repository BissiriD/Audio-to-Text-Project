thethe question i am most commonly asked about climate change is should i be optimistic or pessimistici thought about this question a lot my career has been at the intersection of climate science technology policy and industry mostly working for you at one point working for you as president and now as chief scientist and chief carbon wrangler at carbon direct at that intersection i think about that question in terms of energy flowsand carbon abatement options so i ponder a variant of that question how much energy should ten billion people use i was first prompted to think about this question by the late great richard smalley nanotechnologies nobel prize winning chemist co discovered buckyballstotal mench he gave an important and influential talk almost exactly twenty years ago in which he laid out the top ten challenges to humanity energy water food poverty the environment health and then said something kind of obvious all of these are energy challengeswater is the most straightforward three quarters of the earth's surface is covered with water it's too salty to drink or use the primary cost of desalination is energy food i like food eighty percent of the food consumed around the world moves through modern agriculture that means synthetic fertilizerscombines that harvest refrigeration shipping they're all energy climate that's my day job how do we go from fifty four billion tons of greenhouse gases every year to less than zero very quickly and so on abundant clean energy can make progress against this whole list so richard estimated whathe thought it would take for ten billion humans to live more or less like the united states and his answer wassixty terawattskeep that number in your mind sixty for reference today the world uses about twenty six terawatts of energy about eight terawatts of that our electricity now the urgency of climate means that we have tofor all of the energy we use today and all future energy really has to be abundant sustainable and cheapabundant available where you want it when you want it everybody should have energy including the three billion people who use less electricity than my refrigerator uses however it should also be sustainable we can't emit a lot of greenhouse gases we can't trash natureideally it's cheap a lot cheaper than today maybe half or a third of what the u s pays that would be twenty dollars a megawatt hour or a dollar a giggle and remember it's energy not electricity we also need heat for heavy industry we need clean fuels thingsclean hydrogen or sustainable aviation fuelswell that seems hardand it is but if you know that's what you need or what you want abundant sustainable cheap energy we have a new question to ponder how do we get sixty terawatts of that to ten billion peoplewell the good news is every day the earth receives one hundred and sixty three thousand terawatts of energy from the sun about half of that bounces back to space but about eighty thousand terawatts arrive at the earth in a form we can use for example the air land and oceans convert some of that into about eight hundred and seventy terawatts of windthese are bigger numbers than sixty and we've got more than solar and wind we have geothermal we have hydro we have nuclear there's other kinds of clean energies and some of the best resources are in fact in the global south these places are not simply future climate victims these places are latent energy susuperpowers and we've made some good starts let's look at chile blessed with abundant hydro solar and wind they can make green electrons on demand a lot of those green electrons are going to get turned into hydrogen and ammonia the key ingredient for fertilizer itself a good fuel and a great way to move clean aireg around the world now chile has prioritized using these green electrons and hydrogen to decarbonise its own grid and for domestic energy use for things like mining they are also building infrastructure they're building up the grid and ports for trade and commerce this prioritizationthis emphasis on infrastructure is the difference between a neo colonial economy and a new economy built on abundance let's go to kenyahome of the second most productive wind farm on earth and lake turkana home of the second largest geothermal program on earth and future home of the great carbon valley where this abundant sustainable cheap energy will create whole new industries and pull c o two out of the sky now those are good starts butwe have far far to go hashtag we need more specifically we need new investment vehicles and we need development mechanisms that recognize the opportunity of abundance as opposed to being built on the scarcities of the past my favorite example namibia a young rapidly growing nation full of hppromise one of the very driest places on earth namibia has excellent solar and wind resources in particular in the southwest unsurprisingly a giant ten billion dollar project is bouldering along that will land three thousand megawatts of solar on the ground three thousand megawatts of wind that will feed three thousand megawatts of onenaturalizer that'll make clean hydrogen and ammonia for export to europe and european countries and european industries are providing the long-term off cakesin addition the port of louder ets is getting an upgrade and there's going to be jobs and wealth creation in namibia i love this project will start to like namibia gets wealth and jobs europe gets clean secure energy suppliesstill something's offthat's it this project is ten times bigger than namibia whole gridand this project will not substantially build out the infrastructure or energy access no refrigerators no new course as a nation now again this is a great project but how can we do even better not just here but everywhere how do we harness abundant sustainable cheap energy for allwell there's three ingredients to that bouillabaisse and if you plan to harvest abundance you act differently in each first out of the gate infrastructure we need transmission lines roads ports railroads fueling stations we're not moving backsince we're moving molecules in electrons we need this infrastructure to get electricity to the people of namibia and to get clean fuels out of ports like mombasa or cartagena these projects take time money and people we need to develop the human capital as part of these investment projects for decadesbecause remember children for the rest of our lives every week is infrastructure weeksecond out of the gate innovation we need much more energy in many places much cheaper that's an innovation agenda now all y'all are familiar with the profound and rapid decreases in cost associated with solar photovoltaics that was a combination of sustained investment in innovation playgas market aligning policies plus mass manufacturing for solar that was the united states germany china and others acting together well if that's the recipe we can do that again we're already doing it with electric vehicles and clean hydrogen production we can certainly do it by turning electricity into fuels and pulling c o two out ofthe sky in fact the c o two and clean hydrogen will be the next generation of sustainable maritime and aviation fuels we can go way farther with solar with perovskites with multi axon technologies like super molecules we can double or even triple the outputwe just have fusionin californianot a harness that abundance and objective should be cost reduction maybe fifty or even eighty percent cost reduction and those objectives should be part of the goals of the institutions that run innovation for example the u s department of energy's earth shot programs thirdinvestment specifically we need to move away from single project finance to more systemic investment mechanisms one that reimagined risk across multiple projects multiple investment cycles and multiple years some of the goals of the audacious and overdue bridgetown initiativein addition the full value chain should be part of the investment thesis revenues come from many sources including the infrastructure itself the equipment sales the new products and the improvements for health and welfare global positive investment global positive growth thatyield solid returns now in the case of chile japan is a key partner and japanese firms will make money on turbines electrolytes hers ships infrastructure debtnow one green hydrogen project is not enough money to do that you needbuild shipyards and supply chains you need more than one project so the japanese government has in fact backed dozens of projects and these are anchored by bilateral agreements between chile and japan that include long-term off takes multiple projects and long-term off takes change the value perpropositions for both countries you're not feeding a set of shareholders or feeding two nations in chile has maintained its commitment to this now through three successive governmentsso let's go back to namibia here's the grid today instead of conventional project finance for one project what would one hundred billion dollar set of projects look like well for starters it should have to build out the grid a lotyou have to add solar and wind maybe supersize some projects maybe add some hydro-power instead of temporary construction jobs and louder it's you'd have a permanent construction industry there and you'd be building electrolyzed was all over namibia that would anchor supply chains across sub saharan africa and you train a generation of workersthat would be big enough for desalination bringing fresh water to the desert into the communities into the new industries big enough for hospitals universities regional logistics hubs big enough to encourage good governance and best of all low cost clean fertilizer that can be used to make food in namibia soldthey're into it's neighbors in effect namibia could be a global anchor for food and fuel and the investors will get a solid return now that's a future to be optimistic about so because let's be honest whether i'm optimistic or notthe work looks the samesolet's reimagine that first question doesn't matter whether i'm optimistic or you're optimistic it matters if we're optimisticcollective action building together is what makes the difficult possible and nourishes the soul through mission and purposeand we have a lot to be optimistic about infrastructure innovation and investment our commitments to the future anchored in optimism we also have the tools and tech we need we know what to doand we can act not out of anger or fear but out of generosity and common purpose bringing aspiration and humility together we're going to build a thriving vibrant exciting world full of generosity and full of potential that's going to be built on the back of infrastructure innovationan investment that will harness the abundant sustainable cheap energy that is our planet's endowmentthank youthree
