the there's something really incredible happening so it is over a billion people who have no access to energy whatsoeveracross the world six hundred and twenty million of them here in africa it costs about fifteen one hundred dollars to connect each household up to the grid if you're going to wait for it takes about nine years on average mean that feels like a lifetime when you try to make that happen that's kind of unbelievable and it's also unacceptable so longdo something about itthe light bulb comes from this idea that you have an energy system that is made up of the ideas of tesla and the ideas of thomas edison there was an evolution that said it's not just about the lightbulb it's about the whole system the whole energy system that goes with that light bulb and what happened in that gildedage was the creation of an industrial system that every country around the world has now started to emulate so to get to the appliances you need to have power stations from power stations need to have infrastructure and that infrastructure that takes you to the point of having electricity and you get to to the lightbulbs in the appliances that we all take for grantedbut the amazing thing in ways that there's a revolution happening in the villages and towns all around us here in east africa and the revolution is an echo of the cell phone revolutionit's wireless and that revolution is about solar and it's about distributed solar photons a wireless they fall on every rooftop and they generate enough power to be sufficient for every household needso that's an incredible thing is also a problem with itup until now the technology hasn't been there to make it happen and the mindset has been that we have to have the grid to provide industrial growth and let countries develop and create jobs and and industrializesowe've gotten ourselves to the point where actually the the costs of building these grids and following that pattern of development are really unsustainableif you add up the deficits that all of the utilities run in africasub saharan africayou get to a number of twenty one billion dollars every year to maintain that system and keep it going to an extraordinary amount of resource that's been put into creating a system thatultimately we'll have to wait a very long time for and when it comes it often doesn't come with sufficient robustness to allow us to go down that path to development so what what a shame but here's what's happening and here's the opportunity that i think we should all get excited aboutso there's a group of companies that have been chipping away at this problem over the last ten years and this group of companies have recognized the reality that there's a great big nuclear reactor up there in the sky and that africa is more endowed with that solar power that comes from the sky the sunon an almost any other continent so the opportunity has come to convert some of that sort of power wireless power into energy at the household level and three things have happened at the same time burst the costs of solar productivity have come down so putting a panel on your roof and generating power from itthat cost has absolutely collapsed over the last thirty years and has gone down by ninety five percent second the appliance network so the the group of appliances that we've all gotten used to we all want we'll need we'll see as part of our everyday lives that give us health and security those appliances have come down in cost if you take the l e d lightbulb for example very simple thing five years ago that were then now eighty five percent less than they were five years ago and thentheir efficiency when you compare them to an incandescent bulb the light bulb i showed in the previous slideis incredible ten times they they give you ten times the amount of lines and they last thirty times as long and then the last thing has happened is of course the cell phone revolution so we're piggybacking off the cell phone revolution and we can now make decentralized customers make small payments for bits of equipment and appliances were actuallywe are now affordable we can pay them off over a daily or a weekly schedule so this is an incredible change in the economy that is happening and it's really opened up something very very innovative so i'm going to introduce you to a lady i met with last weekend i'm susan may not look like it but susan is a representative of a twenty sevenbillion dollar markettwenty seven billion dollars is what people like susan spend every year on cell phone charging and flashlight batteries and kerosene to light their homes so as susan is a proud owner of a small solar systemas a kid rather than a planetary thing so a small solar system and her small so system allows her to have a couple of light bulbs and she's made this transition has jumped from kerosene into light just four or five lights on the radio is fantasticand she talks about it she talks about her kids doing homework at night and because she has light i'm not sure what the kids feel about laughing as she talks about themshe talks about the fact that she can go out at four am and look after the cows and she's not so worried but she also talks about this little twinkle in her eyes she talks about how light turns her house into a home at night she's not scared of her own house at night because it has light in it and i thought that was amazingso susan and does something that many customers of these companies that i talked about do and she forces us to innovate she challenges companies say well i've got the radio in the lives of like a tvi'd like to entertain educateyup me and my kids and then i'd like to have some hair clippers my kids you have to cut my kids hair and i'd love to have a fridge and she's coined something that the energy world is really hungry to do the idea that she's coined as the as the energy ladder starts again with a light bulband a light bulb is an idea that we can get our kids to do homework and very cheap about five dollars and we can get it distributed but then let's go up from there this is susan has four light bulbs radio maybe a little flashlight a little solar panel on the roof and then let's go up againwe can get maybe at about five hundred dollars a previous kit was maybe one hundred and fifty again paid for overtime two years to pay it all off you can get the tv to the light bulbs on the tv and you start to ask yourself so where's this headedis this headed herenow where we can have distributed systems with the right infrastructure to provide power for our hospitals and our schools and really how far can this go and this is the mindset shift that i think is really exciting how far can this go could we get up to here this is the conceptual design for onethe world's biggest factories designed to be fully solar powered and fully off gridmaybe we can byso there's a generation of these companies that are that are that are out there doing this work and creating thousands of jobs creating selling tens of thousands of these solar systems so bringing tens of thousands of families in delight and tackling that big one billion dollar problem that i talked aboutbeginning and and really innovating and what they're doing is they're not only energy companies they're also credit finance companies that that bringing people into an economythey're retailing the plant retail companies so they're taking products out to people in the connecting markets and and their appliance companies so they're developing extraordinary products that are very efficient and very cheapso an extraordinary thing is happening out there that some that's worth recognizingand where does it take us from a governmental perspective and from a social perspective it takes us out to two really big goals we aspire towards energy access for everybodyand we aspire towards a low carbon economy fully functioning low carbon economy and we're getting to the point where we're seeing the fully functioning low carbon economy is not just about andgetting people onto the grid it's about getting people onto electricity and doing it in a way that's really dignifiedso i want us all to picture it for a moment really picture what this could meanand an energy system that is not just about subsistence power getting the family of the kerosene but it's actually the full suite of appliances andtools and productivity that we've all gotten used to so actually energy at a scale that can drive industrial developmentand it's the ability to have andpowerful tools have the ability to be productive in households as a farmer or as a carpenter or as a tailor and get your businesses to work and bring you into the economy and i was working again in a couple of days ago with a farmer just outside of nairobi small fields and he has an irrigation pump that is run off solarand he was bragging about how much of a difference it made to his productivity when we were listening to him we were asking ourselves at what point will it be that actually you will be charging an electric scooter off your rooftop and taking your crops to market onwith mobility that you've charged yourself using your own power and thus an extraordinary thing that's happening and if you listen to susan e listen to francis you get to this point where you say these guys have this extraordinary sense of dignity about the way they're achieving their power the sense of ownership and the sense of prideand i'm going to flip into a little tiny video clip which is from a distributor of one of these companies that i'm talking about and he puts it better than anyone i've ever heard it from justice listen to thatso if if it does happen we get to a point where every home has their moon independence dimension that will give us the democracyand everybody has doctrines and everybody moves when they want to see the senate since with anyone who stonedthat that freedom getting back into the hands of the casinoitbrilliant that was martinand he has a really wonderful ten affairs and what a sense of vision that he he captures so picture that for a moment every householda proud producer as well as consumer of energythe ability to generate power to share power to sell power all coming from your own generating asset sitting on your own property maybe even think about crowdsourcing with your neighbors the grid from the ground up rather than waiting for the government to bring it from the top downso in africa we have this extraordinary opportunity right now an extraordinary opportunity to change the world and create an energy system that everybody will be jealous ofand everybody will look to us as the innovators ofand that's the democracy of energythank you very muchthirty seven it's it's it's a really exciting vision help us understand what are the key roadblocks right now like what could make this go faster so the first one i think is is really the intermittency of solar power so you've got the problem is that the santa luciaruns for twelve hours a day so you've got darkness for twelve hours a day and we need to have storage solutions that are better to help us take us down that path so storage is really one second and those prices are coming those prices are coming down very quick second and the appliance set so the appliance that needs to get more efficient than it needs to get more diversewe need to do more of the things that we in africa want to do with the appliance that these dcf lines dc appliances and i think there's a real opportunity that chris i think the appropriate opportunity is that we could shift some of these twenty one billion dollars of subsidies that governments are spending on on the current electricity system and we could promote r and dhere in africa to create some of these products to be some of these entrepreneurs and make this happiness i create this new system here and some of the companies themselves i mean there's plenty of demand there what since what's holding them back from supplying that demand i mean some of them talk about they they would like to sell tenax what they can contributeso for many of these capitals is that markets don't price consumer risk very well and particularly in markets like ours and emerging markets and here in africa so there's not enough working capital coming into this space because the big finances look at this space and they say well i dunno how to price at risk so i'm going to stay away from itand that's really holding a love of these companies backwell it's incredibly exciting to picture what what could happen here in my mind this might be the biggest leapfrog of them all and thank you for all you're doing and thank you for sharing that vision the
