thei haven't been big beautiful british columbia and my life is fueled by exploring nature both at home and around the world in fact this is from the himalaya just a few months ago when i was climbing there nature is a huge part of my life and it inspires my creative and professional world as well i work hard with my team inspired by nature and envyvancouver designing buildings as an architectural practice we have two main missions our first mission is to focus on making beautiful buildings that serve our community and respond to the needs of the people within them the second mission we have is focused on the fact that the first mission has a huge impact on the planetand on climate change and we have to work to reduce it as a result our firm is often called a highly sustainable practice and the truth is it really is in fact i don't believe that word sustainable building or sustainable practice is really true in most cases and the reason is the built environmentuses enormous amount of the world's resources and far too few of those come from renewable resources in fact the vast majority of the material the man makes on earth goes into the built environment the other challenge with buildings as they represent about thirty nine percent of our greenhouse gas emissions or in north america almost halfour greenhouse gas emissions for reference because it's not talked about enough all have cars planes automobiles the entire transportation sector combined represent only about twenty three percent so buildings are a huge part of the problem and not discussed enough the reason for that or both the heating and cooling of buildings of coursebut also the materials that go into building so when it comes to materials the building structures what holds the buildings are really are composed of four major materials in every city on a planet concrete steel masonry and wood and of those four materials three of them have very very high carbon footprints in particular conchgreat and steal now wood is the only material on that list that's also a renewable resource and sequesters carbon so it's the only pathway as a material that actually can get us to carbon neutral buildings and it's the pathway we choose in our practice to build all buildings so our practice has been a timber only practice since our inceptionshe and as part of our advocacy for the use of wood in buildings about fifteen years ago i wrote a book called the case for tall wood buildings and that book taught the lesson of why we should do this and how we should do this and in the beginning it was a very unlikely concept that people had a hard time believing and yes we figured out that we could have built the empire state building entirely out ofwould that early idea now is a mainstream concept around the world and in sustainable building practices and there are hundreds of tall wood buildings that have either been built or are currently under design and construction and thousands more to come but would as a sustainable idea is not sustainable unless it actually comesfrom sustainable forest practices and much of the planet has forests that we actually need to keep standing as part of our climate solution and in fact lots of the world have forests that are under deep threat if we think about where population in the world mostly resides and where it's growing the quickest in fact most of those areas either don't have forest or also are aware of these fourus are threatened and so would as good a solution as it is and a solution that i still very much believe in is not a global solution most of our cities are still built in those first three materials steel concrete and masonry and they have a high carbon footprint we're working hard and people are working hard to make concrete and steel better but unfortunately tweaking those existsting materials is making them only modestly better in the case of concrete it's estimated they can reduce the carbon footprint of concrete at best between ten and thirty five percent and that's a long way to go from where we need to be either a carbon neutrality inner cities or better yet in carbon sequestering carbon negative buildings so how do we get thereafter building about a million and a half square feet of mass timber i still believe in that material but i keep asking myself this question what is the alternative to the big four in the answer in my mind without question is studying and understanding what's happening in nature and nature's structures combining that with modern biotechnologyand combining that with all of the computer modeling that allows us to make incredibly efficient structures going forward all those things together are creating what we call five five as a fifth way a new structural material that will replace in my mind over time the big four it's an all organicthe material made from forests and crops that can be grown all over the world strong and safe and eventually will be cost effective and competitive against any other material available now this isn't a new idea products made from natural materials thankfully are growing up everywhere there's a huge industry of biomaterials materials in academiaas well as in private business and we're seeing new products come online every day this community is strong and hopefully getting stronger and our contribution to it is really focused on this idea the biggest material use which again is the building structureso how does it work so the idea is based on the same concept of how a tree works or any other vascular plant as we zoom in a tree is sort of made of lignum fide tissues that go from the bottom of the tree to the top as our plants and those liquefied tissues have within them in the cell structure sallyless fibers and lignum that together make the plant strong in order to grow and thrive and those two materials the fiber and the plant as well as the lignin as well as other binders make up the ingredients of what we call five studying the fibers and how they work in plants is another part of howwe're trying to make the structure and if we all imagine cutting through branches the image just showed we know that nature finds very efficient ways to create structures and they're often round like a branch but as humans we tend to make boxy structures and the reason we do that is concrete steel and these materials and wood are more affichepatient when we form them as a box or when we cut them as a box it's more affordable and that's why we see it so a typical structure has columns and beams and a slab to make it up and they're very boxy forms as you can see in the image now different structures behave very differently all the time this particular structure is an example froma tall building but if we talking about a house it would be different structure if we're talking about a hockey rink it would be another structure so just in this example how did the forces work while you have the force of the way to people and you have the force of the weight of a building above you have wind blowing on the sides earthquake impacting the forces as they press down on this particular examsample in blue are forces of compression that's the squeezing forces pushing down the forces here in yellow are the tension forces the pulling apart on that structure when we put those together we see how the forces moved to the ground through this simple frame and it's sort of a flowing diagram in fact when we use what's keyall the structural stress plot you can see that the form is very natural in it's character but as i said we build things out of boxes and when we overlap in our example a boxy structure of wood for example we see these areas in red which really are unnecessary they're wasted material and the current way we built in this example working with our engineyears we actually calculated that this particular example would result in about twenty seven percent material waste now all buildings are different and it's very hard to make a sort of overall calculation some buildings more efficient some less efficient but if we multiply this by the amount of building that needs to be built over the next forty years for humanityit's an incredible amount of human wasteand poor use of our resourcesso our goal with five is how do we use as little resources as possible and when you use little resources in a building and you lightened the building up and a lighter building actually means that it weighs less on the ground in our foundations below the ground can be lighter as well so less resources equals later buildings equals even less resourcestaking this idea of how five can use last we took four existing known solutions and put them together the first is we take those plant fibers i described and that can come from trees that can come from plants grass bamboo it can come from waste wood products that can come from clearing the understory of a forest to make it less likelyfor forest fire in places like california we take those fibers and combine them with other organic binders and lignin in order to sort of create a solid product and then we take these computer models that allow us to really design efficiency into the way we build so we can boil out all that waste and then finally we're going to use carssome robotics that means that every part of a building rather than being cookie cutter and the same and wasteful can be just as much material as needed to know more in order to make the building safe together that makes something that looks like this and again this is an example the flat top is flat because we walk on floors but underneath the building looks more organicand it's shape and as you can see these beams and columns feel a little bit more like branches and more like what we see in nature as we zoom in even further we start to see how it's actually composed and you may think in your mind is this fiberboard is this article boring things you've seen before will actually what we're talking about is a very microscopic layerairing of these plant fibers than just a millimeter long by laying them together and cross laminating them across each other we can customize the way based again on the structural model exactly how the composition of each piece of the material works in order to make it as efficient as possible we combine it with these organic polymers andand and also lately make this material is strong dense and behaves much like a tree now we do that in another unique way in the way the forming works because no pieces of a structure have to be the same and we want to reduce waste we use robotic forms and fabric forms the red is fabric that moves in and out and allows each piece of the bbuilding to be completely uniquely customizable and again we're using it to reduce the waste of a structure now when we put that all together it looks like something completely different something that none of us have seen before it's not like steals not like concrete and it's not like wood instead in this example what you see as an entirely plantbase structure it's healthy and beautiful to be around it's shapes are not there as decoration there there is just structural essentials and yet they're beautiful it's safe to be within it sequesters carbon so it's part of our solution for climate change i believe we cannot continue to workwith broken systems and try to make them better we have to imagine something next we also can't wait for the world's resources to run out before we imagine a future that's differentwe are no longer part of an industrial revolution of materials we were at the beginning of mother nature's revolution in materialsas a result we can make much more beautiful environments for everyoneas i walk around the forest my home and i look at up into the trees and imagine what the buildings of the future are i imagine that they'll use less resources they'll have less impact they will still make strong healthy communities for all of usbut they'll do so more efficientlyall of these ideas are ideas that already exist there's nothing new here we have an opportunity to live in a completely biological world we just have to decide too so there is a community growing of companies and products and bio materials that are available and every day there are new materials introduced into the systemwe can and we will solve this combination of human need and the planets need at the same time all we need to do is listen to nature and let her teach us how
