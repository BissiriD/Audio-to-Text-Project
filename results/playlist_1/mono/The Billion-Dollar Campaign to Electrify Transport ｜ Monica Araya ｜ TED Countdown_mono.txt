thea year ago at global countdowns virtual launch monica araya who among many other things is a distinguished fellow at the climate works foundation she shouldn't use of a campaign to take on the massive emissions from the world's carsas trucks and buses etcand we have an excitingupdate we want to share with you monika welcome here to the countdown stage thank you it's so great the luck you're up against a vast industry i mean there are more than a billion polluting vehicles out there how on earth can you attempt systemchange that at that scalewell that is the point that because of this scale and because of this speed that we need to inject into this transformation we have to work with all the levers of change simultaneously that's that's the key point so cds we have to engage with cities that's greatnot enough we have to engage with politicians we have to engage with the companies themselves we have to create business coalitions and we also have to empower citizens so that they play did act ultimately we know that we have to create political space for stricter regulationsfor policy so that is something we are doing right now and innocence isn't separate initiatives they all build on each otherexactly so think about an automaker you know maybe we have some in the roomso you're not going to give up your profits just like thisbutif you hear that so many cds start saying no more petrol and diesel cars are going to circulate in our streets and you hear the politicians saying that life is going to get more difficult for fossil fuels and you turn on the tv and you see millions of people saying you know we're atangry about the products that you're making and you look at the demand and you look at companies that are saying you know what we're switching is working we're saving money then you have to act but how could you take on all these agendas at oncethat's the point you can do just one thing or you can just expect one single organization to do this so this is the exciting newsa group of over sent seventy seven zero organizations are coming together creating a coalition a global campaign we call it drive electric and he's already shaking things up alsowell the best thing would be to give you one example from from this yearso partners of this coalition have doing an amazing job persuading the european commission to propose that after twenty thirty five there will be no more sales of petrol and diesel cars and this alone was unthinkable two years agoand even though i mentioned in europe their progress is happening from china to california and everything in between including small countries so monica what's the overall goal of the drive electric campaignwell we have to persuade the world to do exactly what i just mentioned and actually in some cities and some countries you can actually go faster and the point is that we need to set these timelines make it normal you know say after this year say twenty thirty five we're notgoing to sell more petrol and diesel cars in our campaign works with all segments so we say buses twenty thirty trucks twenty fortyand if we want to get there if we say we have to be here by twenty thirty five then the next five years are so critical so that is what what we have to achieve you know we have to get to these mark a tipping point but just to play devil's advocate there and you'd like towell you know that's okaywouldn't some people say that actually we were kind of already at that tipping point and the innocence the move to electrification is already an optimal thank you because that's a very important questionyou know it reflected were making progress and that's a good thingso somebody could say well you know this this day take tesla you know super pioneering deserves a lot of credit and yet if we look at our partners early on they advocated the very policies to promote early adoption of electric vehicles the timing is everythingwe cannot waste any any any time so if you look at the progress we're making yes it's there and yet only one percent of the global stock of cars and trucks is electric right now so we have to keep that in mind and also you know coming from a developing country myself costa rica as you know i would notsay that in the global south this is already inevitable in fact when you look at som industry projections you still find that at least some companies yellow to fossil fuel cars in their future up to two thousand and fiftyokay so if that's still happening in twenty fifty we're we're we're screwed out since the goals of the company especially to accelerate that by how much so here's the point the campaign in the next year is going to accelerate this twenty years twenty years make it happen faster and we calculate thatnow you liked the numbers so we calculate thatdoing that faster will save the planet one hundred and sixty gigatons of c o two equivalent one hundred and sixty billion tons of c o two soon my mouse that's more than three years worth of humanity's entire emissions excess emissions so that's a huge huge number but you're you're up againstindustries that is you know getting trillions of dollars of of revenue and annually how can your coalition possibly take that wrongwell there is opposition and the more progress we make the more the opposition gets activated so that's why we're saying dr electric is the most ambitious coalition and campaigns in our space ever undertaken and where we need to make sure is that we grow itwe grow the partners and we secure funding for what they do because they are playing they are playing a key role in in india and geography is playing all these leavers so we have to make sure they get the resources to work on the ground so raising money not just for climate works but for all of the partners yes how much is it going to takefor the next five years roughly one billion dollarsmonica has you know when i when i first heard that number i said no way i'm going for it because you'll hear this from philanthropists there's no precedent for that and yet this is kind of where the exciting news comes in becausedrive electric and and ted and count down anda coalition of visionary donors called the audacious project have been working together on this and just a few weeks ago something kind of amazing happened we were able to secure a commitment from them for about three hundred million dollarsthis was this was really exciting and it builds on a couple of million already committed by the founding donors of dr electric so that we're already over halfway to your billion dollar goal right so howhow is this how does this fail wait wait where are you now it's a it's a is electrifyingbut i mean i know that our partners here i can i can see where they are sitting from foundations i'm sure anthony's somewhere here we are so excited because we have come to a point where we know this campaign is unstoppable andand in short you know we are going to make sure that all of this gets translated into all these strategies that we have to deploy in the key geographies and think about the fact that this is happening just as we move to call so that is also very good news and everyonein this room can actually play a part and so or indeed if you're watching online if you live in a city please advocate to create and expand a green zone where only electric vehicles are welcome if you're working government raise your level of ambitions ignore the flobbyists this is a winning political issue for youif you are a citizen can see they're not buying an internal combustion car and why not share it sharing with friends shared in your social mediaif you are if you are a creative if you are an influencer if you're an artist help us we need to find new and better ways of telling the storyand finally if you work for a company that makes or uses cars trucks motorized vehicles of any kind do what you can to urge them to get on the right side of historyi mean monica what do you think can we actually do thisyes we have to work together go faster and let me finish by saying thisthis campaign is about changing transportation with all the benefits that that brings to people and the planet and yet it is also about showing how systems change works in practice in making sure it happens everywhere also let's do it let's do it thank you momnica thank the
